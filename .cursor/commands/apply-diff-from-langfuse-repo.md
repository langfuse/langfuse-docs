# Apply changes from langfuse/langfuse to langfuse-docs

I made changes in the langfuse/langfuse repository. I want to update the documentation in this repository to reflect those changes.

# Instructions

1. Get the diff compared to main branch from the langfuse/langfuse repository. You can find it in ../langfuse (same parent folder, sibling to langfuse-docs)
2. Study the diff and reason about the changes. What has changed? What's new? What's removed?
3. Research the current documentation on this topic. What files need changes? What needs to be added/removed to make the documentation up to date?
4. Make the necessary changes to the documentation in the langfuse-docs repository.
5. If it is a new feature, consider adding a new changelog post. If unsure, ask me whether I want you to add a changelog post.

# General rules

- This is the documentation for the Langfuse website.
- We use Nextra.site, v3, docs: https://nextra-v2-7hslbun8z-shud.vercel.app/
- All pages are in the /pages folder and rendered by Nextra.site.
- Reusable markdown components are in the /components-mdx folder.
- The devserver is running on http://localhost:3333.

## Frontend

- When using tailwindcss, never use explicit colors, always use the default semantic color tokens introduced by shadcn/ui.

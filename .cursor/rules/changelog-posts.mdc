# Changelog Posts Guidelines

## Overview

Changelog posts document updates, new features, bug fixes, and improvements. They serve as a historical record of changes and provide clarity for users and developers alike.

## File Placement

- Place all changelog posts in the `/pages/changelog` directory.
- Use a clear naming convention (e.g., include the date and a brief description, such as `2023-10-01-new-feature.md`).
- Please make sure you use today's date. If unsure, use terminal to get today's date.

## Frontmatter Configuration Options

Each changelog post should define the following frontmatter fields:

- **title** (string, required):
  The title of the changelog entry, displayed prominently in both the header and index.

- **description** (string, required):
  A concise summary of the changes covered in the post.

- **date** (string, required):
  The release date of the update. Use a date format that can be parsed by JavaScript (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD). This is formatted and displayed in the changelog header and index.

- **author** (string, required):
  The name or identifier of the author responsible for the changelog entry.

- **showOgInHeader** (boolean, optional):
  Set to false to hide the media in the header. If omitted or true, media will be rendered as described below.

- **ogVideo** (string, optional):
  mp4 file url for video, needs to be 16:9. Usually hosted on https://static.langfuse.com/docs-videos (cloudflare r2 bucket).

- **ogImage** (string, optional):
  The URL of an image to display if there is no video. If both an image and a GIF are provided, the GIF may be prioritized.

- **gif** (string, optional):
  URL for an animated GIF. This can be used in place of a static image if desired.

_Note_: The display components (`ChangelogHeader.tsx` and `ChangelogIndex.tsx`) use these options in the following priority order:

1. Fallback Video (`ogVideo`)
2. Image (`ogImage`), optionally replaced by `gif` if provided

## Content Structure

- After the frontmatter
- Never forget to add the `ChangelogHeader` component after the frontmatter.

  ```tsx
  import { ChangelogHeader } from "@/components/changelog/ChangelogHeader";

  <ChangelogHeader />;
  ```

- After the header, write your post content in Markdown.
- Structure your content with clear headings and sections, such as:
  - New Features
  - Improvements
  - Bug Fixes
  - Miscellaneous
- Use bullet points and concise paragraphs for readability.
- Maintain a consistent tone and style that aligns with existing changelog examples.

## Examples in Use

- Refer to existing changelog posts in the `/pages/changelog` directory to see real-world examples of how these frontmatter options are applied.
- Notice how the posts integrate media and text to create an engaging changelog experience.

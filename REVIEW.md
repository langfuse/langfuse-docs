# PR Review Guidelines

Please check the following:

- Edited text is grammatically correct (American English)
- Edited text has consistent punctuation
- Code blocks in core documentation include all imports to be self-contained (does not apply to notebooks/cookbooks)
- If blocks of text or code are largely repeated on multiple documentation pages, suggest to consolidate them in `components-mdx` to improve maintainability and consistency.

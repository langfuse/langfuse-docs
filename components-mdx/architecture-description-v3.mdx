Langfuse consists of two application containers, storage components, and an optional LLM API/Gateway.

- [**Application Containers**](/self-hosting/deployment/infrastructure/containers)
  - Langfuse Web: The main web application serving the Langfuse UI and APIs.
  - Langfuse Worker: A worker that asynchronously processes events.
- **Storage Components**:
  - [Postgres](/self-hosting/deployment/infrastructure/postgres): The main database for transactional workloads.
  - [Clickhouse](/self-hosting/deployment/infrastructure/clickhouse): High-performance OLAP database which stores traces, observations, and scores.
  - [Redis/Valkey cache](/self-hosting/deployment/infrastructure/cache): A fast in-memory data structure store. Used for queue and cache operations.
  - [S3/Blob Store](/self-hosting/deployment/infrastructure/blobstorage): Object storage to persist all incoming events, multi-modal inputs, and large exports.
- [**LLM API / Gateway**](/self-hosting/deployment/infrastructure/llm-api): Some features depend on an external LLM API or gateway.

Langfuse can be deployed within a VPC or on-premises in high-security environments.
Internet access is optional.
See [networking](/self-hosting/security/networking) documentation for more details.

```sh
npm install langfuse openai
```

Add your Langfuse credentials to your environment variables. Make sure that you have a `.env` file in your project root and a package like `dotenv` to load the variables.

import EnvJS from "@/components-mdx/env-js.mdx";

<EnvJS />

With your environment configured, call OpenAI SDK methods as usual from the wrapped client.

```ts
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { observeOpenAI } from "langfuse";

const openai = observeOpenAI(new OpenAI());

const res = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [{ role: "system", content: "Tell me a story about a dog." }],
    model: "gpt-4o",
    max_tokens: 300,
});
```

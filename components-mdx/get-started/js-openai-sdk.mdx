**Install package**
```sh
npm install @langfuse/openai
```

**Add credentials**

Add your Langfuse credentials to your environment variables. Make sure that you have a `.env` file in your project root and a package like `dotenv` to load the variables.

import EnvJS from "@/components-mdx/env-js.mdx";
import SetupOtelJS from "@/components-mdx/setup-otel-js.mdx"

<EnvJS />

**Initialize OpenTelemetry**

<SetupOtelJS />

With your environment configured and OpenTelemetry initialized, call OpenAI SDK methods as usual from the wrapped client.

**Wrap OpenAI client**
```ts
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { observeOpenAI } from "@langfuse/openai";

const openai = observeOpenAI(new OpenAI());

const res = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [{ role: "system", content: "Tell me a story about a dog." }],
    model: "gpt-4o",
    max_tokens: 300,
});
```

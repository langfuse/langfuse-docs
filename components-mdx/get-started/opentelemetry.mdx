**Configure OpenTelemetry endpoint**

Langfuse exposes an OpenTelemetry (OTLP) endpoint at `/api/public/otel` that can receive traces from any OpenTelemetry-compatible client. If you already have an OpenTelemetry setup in your application, you can configure Langfuse as an additional backend to receive your traces.

Set the following environment variables to point your OpenTelemetry exporter to Langfuse:

```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/otel" # 🇪🇺 EU data region
# OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://us.cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/otel" # 🇺🇸 US data region

OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Basic ${AUTH_STRING}"
```

**Authenticate with your API keys**

Langfuse uses Basic Auth to authenticate OpenTelemetry requests. Create a base64-encoded string from your Langfuse API keys:

```bash
echo -n "pk-lf-1234567890:sk-lf-1234567890" | base64
```

Use the output as `AUTH_STRING` in the headers configuration above.

**Start tracing**

Once configured, your OpenTelemetry-instrumented application will automatically send traces to Langfuse. This works with any OpenTelemetry-compatible library including OpenLLMetry, OpenLIT, and framework-specific instrumentations.

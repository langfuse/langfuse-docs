The `@observe` decorator is the simplest way to instrument your application. It is a function decorator that can be applied to any function.

It sets the current span in the context for automatic nesting of child spans and automatically ends it when the function returns. It also automatically captures the function name, arguments, and return value.

```python
from langfuse import observe, get_client

@observe
def my_function():
    return "Hello, world!" # Input/output and timings are automatically captured

my_function()

# Flush events in short-lived applications
langfuse = get_client()
langfuse.flush()
```

</Tab>

<Tab>
Context managers are the recommended way to instrument chunks of work in your application as they automatically handle the start and end of spans, and set the current span in the context for automatic nesting of child spans. They provide more control than the `@observe` decorator.

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()

# Create a span using a context manager
with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="process-request") as span:
    # Your processing logic here
    span.update(output="Processing complete")

    # Create a nested generation for an LLM call
    with langfuse.start_as_current_generation(name="llm-response", model="gpt-3.5-turbo") as generation:
        # Your LLM call logic here
        generation.update(output="Generated response")

# All spans are automatically closed when exiting their context blocks


# Flush events in short-lived applications
langfuse.flush()
```

</Tab>

Manual observations give you control over when spans start and end and do not set the current span in the context for automatic nesting of child spans. You must explicitly call `.end()` when they're complete.

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()

# Create a span without a context manager
span = langfuse.start_span(name="user-request")

# Your processing logic here
span.update(output="Request processed")

# Child spans must be created using the parent span object
nested_span = span.start_span(name="nested-span")
nested_span.update(output="Nested span output")

# Important: Manually end the span
nested_span.end()

# Important: Manually end the parent span
span.end()

# Flush events in short-lived applications
langfuse.flush()
```

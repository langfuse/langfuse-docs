Install the OpenTelemetry SDK, which the Langfuse integration uses under the hood to capture the data from each OpenAI call.

```bash
npm install @opentelemetry/sdk-node
```

Next is initializing the tracing system. You can do that either in a dedicated instrumentation file or directly at the top of your main file.

The inline setup is the simplest way to get started. It works well for projects where your main file is executed first and import order is straightforward.

We can now initialize the `LangfuseSpanProcessor` and start the SDK. The `LangfuseSpanProcessor` is the part that takes that collected data and sends it to your Langfuse project. 

Important: start the SDK before initializing the logic that needs to be traced to avoid losing data.

```ts
import { NodeSDK } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-node";
import { LangfuseSpanProcessor } from "@langfuse/otel";
 
const sdk = new NodeSDK({
  spanProcessors: [new LangfuseSpanProcessor()],
});
 
sdk.start();
```

The instrumentation file often preferred when you’re using frameworks that have complex startup order (Next.js, serverless, bundlers) or if you want a clean, predictable place where tracing is always initialized first.

Create an `instrumentation.ts` file, which sets up the _collector_ that gathers data about each OpenAI call. The `LangfuseSpanProcessor` is the part that takes that collected data and sends it to your Langfuse project.

```ts filename="instrumentation.ts" /LangfuseSpanProcessor/
import { NodeSDK } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-node";
import { LangfuseSpanProcessor } from "@langfuse/otel";

const sdk = new NodeSDK({
  spanProcessors: [new LangfuseSpanProcessor()],
});

sdk.start();
```

Import the `instrumentation.ts` file first so all later imports run with tracing enabled.

```ts filename="index.ts"
import "./instrumentation"; // Must be the first import
```

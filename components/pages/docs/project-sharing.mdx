# Project sharing

In the project settings, you can grant access to other users to view and edit your project. You can also revoke access at any time.

<Frame>![Project Sharing](/images/docs/project-sharing.gif)</Frame>

## Roles

- **Owner**: user who created the project; has all permissions
- **Admin**: can edit the project settings and grant access to other users
- **Member**: can view all metrics & create scores, but cannot configure the project
- **Viewer**: view-only access to the project, not to the configuration

## Scopes per role

export function RolePermissionTable() {
  // from langfuse/langfuse
  const RoleScopes = {
      OWNER: [
      "members:read",
      "members:create",
      "members:delete",
      "apiKeys:read",
      "apiKeys:create",
      "apiKeys:delete",
      "objects:publish",
      "objects:bookmark",
      "traces:delete",
      "scores:CUD",
      "project:delete",
      "project:update",
      "project:transfer",

          >{key}</div>
          {value.sort(
            (a, b) => a.localeCompare(b)
          ).map((scope) => (
            <div key={scope}
            className="text-sm mt-1"
            >{scope}</div>
          ))}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>

);

_Roles cover project settings and all features that make permanent changes. The Viewer role has no privileges to make any changes_

    "# Automated Evaluations with Cleanlab\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleanlabâ€™s [Trustworthy Language Model](https://cleanlab.ai/tlm/) (TLM) enables Langfuse users to quickly identify low quality and hallucinated responses from any LLM trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is TLM?\n",
    "\n",
    "TLM is an automated evaluation tool that add reliability and explainability to every LLM output. TLM automatically finds the poor quality and incorrect LLM responses lurking within your production logs and traces. This helps you perform better Evals, with significantly less manual review and annotation work to find these bad responses yourself. TLM also enables smart-routing for LLM-automated responses and decision-making using trustworthiness scores for every LLM output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TLM provides users with:**\n",
    "- Trustworthiness scores and explanation for every LLM response\n",
    "- Higher accuracy: rigorous [benchmarks](https://cleanlab.ai/blog/trustworthy-language-model/) show TLM consistently produces more accurate results than other LLMs like GPT 4/4o and Claude.\n",
    "- Scalable API: designed to handle large datasets, TLM is suitable for most enterprise applications, including data extraction, tagging/labeling, Q&A (RAG), and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will walk you through the process of evaluating LLM responses captured in Langfuse with Cleanlab's Trustworthy Language Models (TLM)."

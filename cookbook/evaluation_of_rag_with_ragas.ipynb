[context precision](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/context_precision.html): Context Precision is a metric that evaluates whether all of the ground-truth relevant items present in the contexts are ranked high. Ideally all the relevant chunks must appear at the top ranks. This metric is computed using the question and the contexts, with values ranging between 0 and 1, where higher scores indicate better precision.\n",

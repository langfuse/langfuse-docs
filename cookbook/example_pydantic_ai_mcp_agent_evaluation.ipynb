    "# Evaluating LLM Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide shows how we think about agent evaluations at Langfuse. Before we dive into the code, let's establish a clear mental model for what we're building and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an LLM Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "An \"agent\" is more than just a single call to an LLM. It's a system that operates in a continuous loop. This loop begins when the LLM receives an input, either from a human or as feedback from a previous step. Based on this input, the LLM decides on an \"Action,\" which often involves calling an external tool like a search API or a database query. This action interacts with an \"Environment,\" which then produces \"Feedback\" (like search results or data) that is fed back to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cycle of Call, Action, Environment, and Feedback continues until the agent decides to stop and generate a final answer. This entire sequence of events is what we call a **\"trace\"** or a **\"trajectory.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "<Frame>\n",
    "![LLM Agent](/images/cookbook/example_pydantic_ai_mcp_agent_evaluation/agent-overview.png)\n",
    "</Frame>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Evaluate Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating these complex, multi-step trajectories is important because they can fail in several ways. We might not have given the agent clear enough instructions, or the LLM itself might fail to generalize its reasoning to new or unexpected user questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common problems when working with agents\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with agents, three problems show up again and again: **understanding, specification,** and **generalization**. You often lack understanding of what the agent actually does on real traffic, what tools it calls, and where it gets stuck, because you're not systematically inspecting traces or linking them to user feedback. \n",
    "\n",
    "The task is frequently underspecified: prompts and examples don't clearly encode what \"good\" behavior is, so the agent improvises in unpredictable ways. And even once you've tightened the spec, the agent may still struggle to generalize, performing well on a few handpicked examples but failing on slightly different real-world queries, unless you add systematic, dataset-based evaluations to check robustness at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "<Frame>\n",
    "![LLM Agent](/images/cookbook/example_pydantic_ai_mcp_agent_evaluation/evaluations.png)\n",
    "</Frame>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 3 Phases of Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of evaluation has a clear, phased approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 1: Early Development (Manual Tracing)** \n",
    "When you're first building an agent, the most valuable thing you can do is simply look at the traces. Manual tracing gives you immediate insight into your agent's reasoning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 2: First Users (Online Evaluation)**\n",
    "As you get your first users, you can implement user feedback mechanisms, like thumbs-up or thumbs-down buttons, to flag problematic traces for review.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 3: Scaling (Offline Evaluation)** \n",
    "The final phase, and the focus of this notebook, is creating an automated \"offline evaluation dataset.\" As you scale, you can't manually review every trace. You need a \"gold standard\" dataset of inputs and their expected outputs or trajectories. This benchmark allows you to test your agent automatically, prevent regressions, and confidently make improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "<Frame>\n",
    "![LLM Agent](/images/cookbook/example_pydantic_ai_mcp_agent_evaluation/issues.png)\n",
    "</Frame>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Focus: Three Offline Evaluation Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will focus on three practical, automated evaluation strategies that use a Langfuse dataset for experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Final Response (Black-Box):** \n",
    "First is the \"Final Response\" evaluation. This method only cares about the user's input and the agent's final answer, completely ignoring the steps it took to get there. It's flexible, but it doesn't tell you *why* an agent failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Trajectory (Glass-Box):**\n",
    "Second is the \"Trajectory\" evaluation. This method checks if the agent took the \"correct path.\" It compares the agent's actual sequence of tool calls against the expected sequence from our benchmark dataset. This helps pinpoint exactly where in the reasoning process a failure occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Single Step (White-Box):**\n",
    "Third is the \"Single Step\" evaluation. This is the most granular test, acting like a unit test for your agent's reasoning. Instead of running the whole agent, it tests each decision-making step in isolation to see if it produces the expected next action.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we will define a sample agent, create a small benchmark dataset, and add LLM-as-a-judge evaluations in Langfuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Note**: In this guide, we are using Pydantic AI agents, but can be generalized to any other framework or tool._\n",

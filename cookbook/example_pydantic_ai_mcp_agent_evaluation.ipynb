        "# Agent Evaluation: How to Evaluate LLM Agents\n",
        "\n",
        "Evaluating AI agents is different from evaluating simple LLM calls. Agents make autonomous, multi-step decisions — calling tools, searching databases, and chaining reasoning — which means a single accuracy score on the final output is not enough. You need to evaluate **what the agent did** (its trajectory), **how it did it** (each individual step), and **whether the result is correct** (the final response).\n",
        "\n",
        "This guide shows how we think about agent evaluations at Langfuse. Before we dive into the code, let's establish a clear mental model for what we're building and testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is an LLM Agent?\n",
        "\n",
        "An LLM agent is more than just a single call to a language model. It's an autonomous system that operates in a continuous loop of reasoning and action. The loop begins when the LLM receives an input — either from a user or as feedback from a previous step. Based on this input, the LLM decides on an **action**, which often involves calling an external tool like a search API, a database query, or a code interpreter. This action interacts with an **environment**, which then produces **feedback** (like search results or data) that is fed back to the LLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "This cycle of reasoning, action, environment interaction, and feedback continues until the agent decides to stop and generate a final answer. This entire sequence of events is what we call a **\"trace\"** or a **\"trajectory\"** — and it's what makes agent evaluation uniquely challenging compared to evaluating a single LLM call.\n",
        "\n",
        "<Frame>\n",
        "![LLM Agent](/images/cookbook/example_pydantic_ai_mcp_agent_evaluation/agent-overview.png)\n",
        "</Frame>\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why Agent Evaluation Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "Evaluating these complex, multi-step trajectories is important because they can fail in several ways. We might not have given the agent clear enough instructions, or the LLM itself might fail to generalize its reasoning to new or unexpected user questions. \n",
        "\n",
        "For more on evaluation fundamentals, see [Evaluation Concepts](/docs/evaluation/core-concepts).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Common Agent Evaluation Challenges\n",
        "\n",
        "When working with agents, three problems show up again and again: **understanding, specification,** and **generalization**. You often lack understanding of what the agent actually does on real traffic, what tools it calls, and where it gets stuck, because you're not systematically inspecting traces or linking them to user feedback. \n",
        "\n",
        "The task is frequently underspecified: prompts and examples don't clearly encode what \"good\" behavior is, so the agent improvises in unpredictable ways. And even once you've tightened the spec, the agent may still struggle to generalize, performing well on a few handpicked examples but failing on slightly different real-world queries, unless you add systematic, dataset-based evaluations to check robustness at scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "<Frame>\n",

        "\n",
        "## The 3 Phases of Agent Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "Agent evaluation is not a one-time activity — it evolves as your agent matures. The process has three distinct phases:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Phase 1: Early Development (Manual Tracing)**  \n",
        "When you're first building an agent, the most valuable thing you can do is inspect its [traces](/docs/observability/overview). Manual tracing gives you immediate insight into the agent's reasoning, tool calls, and failure points. Use Langfuse's trace viewer to step through each action the agent took.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Phase 2: First Users (Online Evaluation)**  \n",
        "As real users interact with your agent, implement feedback mechanisms — like thumbs-up/thumbs-down buttons — to flag problematic traces for review. You can also set up automated [online evaluators](/docs/evaluation/core-concepts#online-evaluation) that score production traces in real time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Phase 3: Scaling (Offline Evaluation)**  \n",
        "The final phase, and the focus of this guide, is creating an automated offline evaluation pipeline. As you scale, you can't manually review every trace. You need a \"gold standard\" [dataset](/docs/evaluation/experiments/datasets) of inputs and their expected outputs or trajectories. This benchmark allows you to [run experiments](/docs/evaluation/experiments/experiments-via-sdk), prevent regressions, and confidently iterate on prompts, models, and tool configurations.\n",
        "\n",
        "<Frame>\n",
        "![LLM Agent](/images/cookbook/example_pydantic_ai_mcp_agent_evaluation/issues.png)\n",
        "</Frame>\n",
        "\n",
        "## Three Agent Evaluation Strategies\n",
        "\n",
        "This guide covers three practical, automated evaluation strategies. Each operates at a different level of granularity and answers a different question about your agent's behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1) Final Response Evaluation (Black-Box):**  \n",
        "This method evaluates only the user's input and the agent's final answer, ignoring the internal steps entirely. It's the simplest to set up and works with any agent framework, but it cannot tell you *why* a failure occurred.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2) Trajectory Evaluation (Glass-Box):**  \n",
        "This method checks whether the agent took the \"correct path.\" It compares the agent's actual sequence of tool calls against the expected sequence from a benchmark dataset. When the final answer is wrong, trajectory evaluation pinpoints exactly where in the reasoning process the failure occurred.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3) Single Step Evaluation (White-Box):**  \n",
        "This is the most granular evaluation strategy, acting like a unit test for agent reasoning. Instead of running the whole agent, it tests each decision-making step in isolation to see if it produces the expected next action. This is especially useful for validating that search queries, API parameters, or tool selections are correct.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Implementation: Evaluate an Agent Step-by-Step\n",
        "\n",
        "Below, we define a sample agent, create a benchmark dataset, and set up automated [LLM-as-a-judge](/docs/evaluation/evaluation-methods/llm-as-a-judge) evaluations in Langfuse. While the code uses Pydantic AI, the evaluation patterns generalize to any agent framework.\n",

        "## Agent Evaluation Best Practices\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on our experience helping teams evaluate agents in production, here are key best practices:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Start with tracing, not scoring.** Before you build automated evaluations, spend time manually reviewing agent traces. The patterns you observe will inform what metrics matter most for your use case. Use [Langfuse tracing](/docs/observability/overview) to inspect every tool call, reasoning step, and intermediate output.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Define success criteria before writing evaluators.** For each test case, explicitly define what \"correct\" looks like at each level — the expected final answer, the expected tool sequence, and the expected search queries. Vague criteria lead to unreliable evaluations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Use all three evaluation levels together.** Final response evaluation tells you *what* went wrong. Trajectory evaluation tells you *where* it went wrong. Single step evaluation tells you *why* it went wrong. Together, they give you a complete picture.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Build your dataset from real failures.** The most valuable test cases come from production traces where the agent failed. Use [annotation queues](/docs/evaluation/evaluation-methods/annotation-queues) to systematically review and label problematic traces, then add them to your evaluation dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Run evaluations in CI/CD.** Integrate agent evaluation into your deployment pipeline using [experiments via SDK](/docs/evaluation/experiments/experiments-via-sdk). Block deployments that cause score regressions on your benchmark dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Compare configurations systematically.** When changing prompts, models, or tools, run the same evaluation dataset across all configurations to make data-driven decisions. The experiment comparison view in Langfuse makes this straightforward.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that you have a working agent evaluation pipeline, here are ways to extend it:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Scale your dataset** with [synthetic data generation](/guides/cookbook/example_synthetic_datasets) to cover more edge cases\n",
        "- **Add online evaluation** to score production traces in real time using [LLM-as-a-Judge](/docs/evaluation/evaluation-methods/llm-as-a-judge)\n",
        "- **Evaluate multi-turn conversations** if your agent handles [multi-turn dialogue](/guides/cookbook/example_evaluating_multi_turn_conversations)\n",
        "- **Monitor agent performance** over time with [custom dashboards](/docs/metrics/features/custom-dashboards) and [score analytics](/docs/evaluation/evaluation-methods/score-analytics)\n",
        "- **Explore the full evaluation roadmap** in our [comprehensive evaluation guide](/blog/2025-11-12-evals)\n",

        "## Frequently Asked Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is agent evaluation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Agent evaluation is the process of systematically testing and measuring the performance of AI agents — autonomous systems that use LLMs to make decisions, call tools, and complete multi-step tasks. Unlike evaluating a single LLM call, agent evaluation must assess the entire trajectory of actions, not just the final output.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How is agent evaluation different from LLM evaluation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Standard LLM evaluation checks whether a model produces a correct or high-quality response to a given prompt. Agent evaluation is more complex because agents make multiple decisions in sequence — choosing which tools to call, what parameters to pass, and when to stop. You need to evaluate not just the final answer, but also the reasoning path (trajectory) and each individual decision (single step).\n",
        "\n",
        "### What are the main types of agent evaluation?\n",
        "\n",
        "There are three main types: **Final Response (Black-Box)** evaluation checks only the end result; **Trajectory (Glass-Box)** evaluation checks whether the agent took the correct sequence of actions; and **Single Step (White-Box)** evaluation tests each individual decision in isolation. Most production systems use a combination of all three.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How do I build an agent evaluation dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "Start by defining test cases that represent your most common and most critical user interactions. Each test case should include the user input, expected facts in the response, the expected sequence of tool calls (trajectory), and expected parameters for key tool calls. Grow your dataset over time by adding cases from real production failures.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Can I use LLM-as-a-judge for agent evaluation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes. LLM-as-a-judge is one of the most effective approaches for agent evaluation because agent outputs are often too complex for simple rule-based checks. You can use different judge prompts for each evaluation level — one for final response quality, one for trajectory correctness, and one for individual step quality. See the [LLM-as-a-Judge documentation](/docs/evaluation/evaluation-methods/llm-as-a-judge) for setup instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How often should I run agent evaluations?\n",
        "\n",
        "Run offline evaluations (experiments) before every deployment that changes prompts, models, or tool configurations. Run online evaluations continuously on production traces to catch issues in real traffic. For a comprehensive approach, see the [evaluation overview](/docs/evaluation/overview)."

      "3. View your traces in the Langfuse UI  \n",
      "\n",
      "Below are the details.\n",
      "\n",
      "–––  \n",
      "1) Install & configure  \n",
      "––––––––––––––––  \n",
      "\n",
      "• Install the Langfuse Python SDK (v3) and, if you’re using OpenAI, the OpenAI SDK:  \n",
      "```bash\n",
      "pip install langfuse openai\n",
      "```  \n",
      "• Set your Langfuse credentials (and region) as environment variables:  \n",

      "You have three choices—pick one or mix and match:\n",
      "\n",
      "A) OpenAI-SDK Drop-in Replacement  \n",
      "—————————————————  \n",
      "If you’re already using the OpenAI Python SDK for calls, you get full tracing by changing only your import:  \n",
      "```diff\n",
      "- import openai\n",
      "+ from langfuse.openai import openai\n",
      "```\n",
      "Everything else (chat.completions.create, streaming, async, functions) works unchanged and is automatically tracked (prompts, usage, latencies, errors).  \n",

      "If you want to trace arbitrary code (database calls, your own logic, custom functions), use the new OpenTelemetry-based Python SDK v3:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Observe decorator (simplest):  \n",
      "```python\n",
      "from langfuse import observe, get_client\n",

      "@observe()\n",
      "def process_data(x):\n",

      "from langfuse import get_client\n",
      "\n",
      "client = get_client()\n",

      "```python\n",
      "span = client.start_span(name=\"background-task\")\n",
      "# … work …\n",
      "span.end()\n",

      "Source: “Overview of the Python SDK v3” and “Instrumentation” docs.  \n",
      "\n",
      "C) Framework-specific integrations  \n",
      "————————————————  \n",
      "Langfuse also ships wrappers/handlers for popular LLM frameworks:\n",
      "\n",
      "• LangChain: use `langfuse.langchain.CallbackHandler` as a callback  \n",
      "• LlamaIndex: via community OTEL instrumentors  \n",
      "• Anthropic: via OpenTelemetry’s `AnthropicInstrumentor()`  \n",

      "3) View your traces  \n",
      "––––––––––––––––––––  \n",
      "\n",
      "After you’ve run your instrumented application, go to your Langfuse project’s “Traces” page. You’ll see each root trace (e.g., a user request) and nested observations/spans for your function calls, LLM generations, external API calls, etc. You can filter by trace ID, user ID, tags, or evaluate them with custom scores.  \n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a step-by-step guide on integrating **Langfuse** with **AutoGen** to achieve comprehensive observability and debugging for your multi-agent LLM applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What is AutoGen?** [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)) is an open-source framework developed by Microsoft for building LLM applications, including agents capable of complex reasoning and interactions. AutoGen simplifies the creation of conversational agents that can collaborate or compete to solve tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What is Langfuse?** [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is an open-source LLM engineering platform. It offers tracing and monitoring capabilities for AI applications. Langfuse helps developers debug, analyze, and optimize their AI systems by providing detailed insights and integrating with a wide array of tools and frameworks through native integrations, OpenTelemetry, and dedicated SDKs.\n",

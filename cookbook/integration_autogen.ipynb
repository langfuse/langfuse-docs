    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to integrate **Langfuse** with **AutoGen** using OpenTelemetry via the **OpenLit** SDK. By the end of this notebook, you will be able to trace your AutoGen applications with Langfuse for improved observability and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What is AutoGen?** [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/) [(GitHub)](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) is an open-source framework developed by Microsoft for building LLM applications, including agents capable of complex reasoning and interactions. AutoGen simplifies the creation of conversational agents that can collaborate or compete to solve tasks.\n",

    "> **What is Langfuse?** [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is an open-source LLM engineering platform. It provides tracing and monitoring capabilities for LLM applications, helping developers debug, analyze, and optimize their AI systems. Langfuse integrates with various tools and frameworks via native integrations, OpenTelemetry, and API/SDKs.\n",

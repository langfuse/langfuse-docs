    "\n",
    "> **What is CrewAI?** [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) ([GitHub](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI)) is a framework for orchestrating autonomous AI agents. CrewAI enables you to create AI teams where each agent has specific roles, tools, and goals, working together to accomplish complex tasks. Each member (agent) brings unique skills and expertise, collaborating seamlessly to achieve your objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What is Langfuse?** [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is a an open-source LLM engineering platform. It offers tracing and monitoring capabilities for AI applications. Langfuse helps developers debug, analyze, and optimize their AI systems by providing detailed insights and integrating with a wide array of tools and frameworks through native integrations, OpenTelemetry, and dedicated SDKs.\n",

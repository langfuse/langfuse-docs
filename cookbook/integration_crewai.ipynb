    "\n",
    "[**AutoGen**](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/) [(GitHub)](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) is an open-source framework developed by Microsoft for building LLM applications, including agents capable of complex reasoning and interactions. AutoGen simplifies the creation of conversational agents that can collaborate or compete to solve tasks.\n",

    "# Cookbook: Monitor DeepSeek Models with Langfuse Using the OpenAI SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "The DeepSeek API uses an API format compatible with OpenAI. By modifying the configuration, you can use the OpenAI SDK or software compatible with the OpenAI API to access the DeepSeek API.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook demonstrates how to monitor [DeepSeek](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3) models using the OpenAI SDK integration with [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com). By leveraging Langfuse's observability tools and the OpenAI SDK, you can effectively debug, monitor, and evaluate your applications that utilize DeepSeek models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will walk you through setting up the integration, making requests to DeepSeek models, and observing the interactions with Langfuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** *Langfuse is also natively integrated with [LangChain](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/langchain/tracing), [LlamaIndex](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/llama-index/get-started), [LiteLLM](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/litellm/tracing), and [other frameworks](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/overview). These frameworks can be used as well to trace DeepSeek requests.*\n",

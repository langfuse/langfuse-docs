    "In this guide, we'll show you how to integrate [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) with [Exa](https://exa.ai/) to trace your AI search operations. By leveraging Langfuse's tracing capabilities, you can automatically capture details such as inputs, outputs, and execution times of your Exa search functions.\n",

    "> **What is Exa?** [Exa](https://exa.ai/) is an AI-powered search API built for LLMs and AI applications. Unlike traditional search engines, Exa is designed to understand semantic meaning and retrieve high-quality, relevant results that are perfect for AI use cases like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), research, and content discovery.\n",

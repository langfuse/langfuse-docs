    "In this guide, we'll show you how to integrate [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) with [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) to trace your web scraping operations. By leveraging Langfuse’s tracing capabilities, you can automatically capture details such as inputs, outputs, and execution times of your Firecrawl functions.\n",

    "> **What is Firecrawl?** [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) is an API service that crawls websites—automatically processing the target URL and its accessible subpages—and converts the retrieved content into clean, LLM-ready markdown. It offers robust scraping, crawling, and extraction capabilities that transform web content (including HTML, metadata, and more) into structured data for various applications.\n",

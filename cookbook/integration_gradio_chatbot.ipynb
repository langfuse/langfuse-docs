        "[Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) is an open-source Python library that enables quick creation of web interfaces for machine learning models, APIs, and Python functions. It allows developers to wrap any Python function with an interactive UI that can be easily shared or embedded, making it ideal for demos, prototypes, and ML model deployment. See [docs](https://www.gradio.app/docs) for more details.\n",

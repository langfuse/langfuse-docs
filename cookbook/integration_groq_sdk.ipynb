    "This cookbook shows two ways to interact with Groq models and trace them with Langfuse:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the OpenAI SDK to interact with the Groq model\n",
    "2. Using the Groq SDK to interact with Groq models\n",

    "**Note:** *Langfuse is also natively integrated with [LangChain](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/langchain/tracing), [LlamaIndex](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/llama-index/get-started), [LiteLLM](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/litellm/tracing), and [other frameworks](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/overview).

    "- **Basic LLM Calls:** Learn how to wrap standard Groq model interactions with Langfuse's `@observe` decorator for comprehensive logging.\n",
    "- **Chained Function Calls:** See how to manage and observe complex workflows where multiple model interactions are linked together to produce a final result.\n",
    "- **Streaming Support:** Discover how to use Langfuse with streaming responses from Groq models, ensuring that real-time interactions are fully traceable.\n",

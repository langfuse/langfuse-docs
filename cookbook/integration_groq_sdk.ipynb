    "This cookbook shows two ways to interact with Groq models and trace them with Langfuse:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the OpenAI SDK to interact with the Groq model\n",
    "2. Using the Groq SDK to interact with Groq models\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these examples, you'll learn how to log and trace interactions with Groq language models, enabling you to debug and evaluate the performance of your AI-driven applications.\n",

    "**Note:** *Langfuse is also natively integrated with [LangChain](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/langchain/tracing), [LlamaIndex](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/llama-index/get-started), [LiteLLM](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/litellm/tracing), and [other frameworks](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/overview).

    "- **Basic LLM Calls:** Learn how to wrap standard Groq model interactions with Langfuse's `@observe` decorator for comprehensive logging.\n",
    "- **Chained Function Calls:** See how to manage and observe complex workflows where multiple model interactions are linked together to produce a final result.\n",
    "- **Streaming Support:** Discover how to use Langfuse with streaming responses from Groq models, ensuring that real-time interactions are fully traceable.\n",

    "# Cookbook: Groq SDK Integration (Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook provides step-by-step examples of integrating Langfuse with the Groq SDK in Python. By following these examples, you'll learn how to log and trace interactions with Groq language models, enabling you to debug and evaluate the performance of your AI-driven applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** *Langfuse is also natively integrated with [LangChain](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/langchain/tracing), [LlamaIndex](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/llama-index/get-started), [LiteLLM](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/litellm/tracing), and [other frameworks](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/overview). If you use one of them, any use of Groq models is instrumented right away.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore various use cases where Langfuse can be integrated with the Groq SDK, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Basic LLM Calls:** Learn how to wrap standard Groq model interactions with Langfuse's `@observe` decorator for comprehensive logging.\n",
    "- **Chained Function Calls:** See how to manage and observe complex workflows where multiple model interactions are linked together to produce a final result.\n",
    "- **Streaming Support:** Discover how to use Langfuse with streaming responses from Groq models, ensuring that real-time interactions are fully traceable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed guidance on the Groq SDK or the **`@observe`** decorator from Langfuse, please refer to the [Groq Documentation](https://console.groq.com/docs) and the [Langfuse Documentation](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python/decorators#log-any-llm-call).\n",

    "\n",
    "We are integrating the Groq SDK with Langfuse using the [`@observe` decorator](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python/decorators), which is crucial for logging and tracing interactions with large language models (LLMs). The `@observe(as_type=\"generation\")` decorator specifically logs LLM interactions, capturing inputs, outputs, and model parameters. The resulting `groq_chat_completion` method can then be used across your project."

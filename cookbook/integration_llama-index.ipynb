A film enthusiast from a young age, his journey began with home movies shot on a Super 8 camera. His passion led him to the University of Southern California (USC), majoring in Film Production. Eventually, he started his career as an assistant director at Paramount Pictures. Silverstein's directorial debut, “Doors Unseen,” a psychological thriller, earned him recognition at the Sundance Film Festival and marked the beginning of a successful directing career.\n",

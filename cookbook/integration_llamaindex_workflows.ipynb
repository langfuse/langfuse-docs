    "> **What are LlamaIndex Workflows?** [LlamaIndex Workflows](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/workflow/) is a flexible, event-driven framework designed to build robust AI agents. In LlamaIndex, workflows are created by chaining together multiple steps—each defined and validated using the `@step` decorator. Every step processes specific event types, allowing you to orchestrate complex processes such as AI agent collaboration, RAG flows, data extraction, and more.\n",

    "> **What is Langfuse?** [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is the open source LLM engineering platform. It helps teams to collaboratively manage prompts, trace applications, debug problems, and evaluate their LLM system in production.\n",

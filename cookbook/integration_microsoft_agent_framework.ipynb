    "> **What is the Microsoft Agent Framework?**: The [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) is an open-source framework for building intelligent agents. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating agents that can interact with various services, execute tasks, and handle complex workflows. The framework supports multiple LLM providers including Azure OpenAI and OpenAI, and offers built-in observability through OpenTelemetry.\n",

    "> **What is Langfuse?**: [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) is an open-source observability platform for AI agents. It helps you visualize and monitor LLM calls, tool usage, cost, latency, and more."

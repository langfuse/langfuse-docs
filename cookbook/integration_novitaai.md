# Observability for Novita AI with Langfuse

This guide shows you how to integrate Novita AI with Langfuse. Novita AI's API endpoints for chat, language and code are fully compatible with OpenAI's API. This allows us to use the Langfuse OpenAI drop-in replacement to trace all parts of your application.

> **What is Novita AI?** [Novita AI](https://novita.ai/) is an AI cloud platform that helps developers easily deploy AI models through a simple API, backed by affordable and reliable GPU cloud infrastructure. Try the [Novita AI Llama 3 API Demo](https://novita.ai/model-api/product/llm-api/playground/meta-llama-llama-3.1-70b-instruct) today!

> **What is Langfuse?** [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is an open source LLM engineering platform that helps teams trace API calls, monitor performance, and debug issues in their AI applications.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Make sure you have installed the necessary Python packages:


```python
!pip install openai langfuse
```

## Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables


```python
import os

# Get keys for your project from the project settings page
# https://cloud.langfuse.com

os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-..." # DOCS EXAMPLE KEYS
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-..." # DOCS EXAMPLE KEYS
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ US region


# Get your Novita AI API key from the project settings page
os.environ["NOVITA_API_KEY"] = "..."
```

## Step 3: Langfuse OpenAI drop-in Replacement

In this step we use the native [OpenAI drop-in replacement](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/openai/python/get-started) by importing `from langfuse.openai import openai`.

To start using Novita AI with OpenAI's client libraries, pass in your Novita AI API key to the `api_key` option, and change the `base_url` to `https://api.novita.ai/v3/openai`:


```python
# instead of import openai:
from langfuse.openai import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
  api_key=os.environ.get("NOVITA_API_KEY"),
  base_url="https://api.novita.ai/v3/openai",
)
```

**Note:** The OpenAI drop-in replacement is fully compatible with the [Low-Level Langfuse Python SDKs](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python/low-level-sdk) and [`@observe()` decorator](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python/decorators) to trace all parts of your application.

## Step 4: Run An Example

The following cell demonstrates how to call Novita AI's chat model using the traced OpenAI client. All API calls will be automatically traced by Langfuse.


```python
client = openai.OpenAI(
  api_key=os.environ.get("NOVITA_API_KEY"),
  base_url="https://api.novita.ai/v3/openai",
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "Act like you are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What are the famous attractions in San Francisco?"},
  ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

    San Francisco, one of the most iconic cities in the world, is home to a plethora of famous attractions that cater to all interests and ages. Here are some of the most popular attractions in San Francisco:
    
    1. **Golden Gate Bridge**: An engineering marvel and a symbol of San Francisco, the Golden Gate Bridge is a must-visit attraction. Take a walk or bike ride across the bridge for spectacular views of the city and the Bay.

    10. **The Exploratorium**: A museum of science, art, and human perception, the Exploratorium is a great place to learn and have fun. With interactive exhibits and stunning views of the Bay, it's a must-visit for families and science enthusiasts.
    11. **Pier 39**: A popular shopping and dining destination, Pier 39 offers stunning views of the Bay Bridge, Alcatraz Island, and the sea lions that call the pier home.
    12. **The de Young Museum**: A fine arts museum located in Golden Gate Park, the de Young Museum features a diverse collection of art and cultural exhibitions from around the world.
    
    These are just a few of the many famous attractions in San Francisco. Whether you're interested in history, culture, science, or entertainment, San Francisco has something for everyone.


## Step 5: See Traces in Langfuse

After running the example model call, you can see the traces in Langfuse. You will see detailed information about your Novita AI API calls, including:

- Request parameters (model, messages, temperature, etc.)
- Response content
- Token usage statistics
- Latency metrics

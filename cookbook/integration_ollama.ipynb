    "\n",
    "**Note: We'll use the Langfuse OpenAI SDK integration for Python in this example. This works the same for [JS/TS](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/openai/js/get-started) or via the Langfuse integrations with [LangChain](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/langchain/tracing) and [LlamaIndex](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/llama-index/get-started).**\n",

    "## What is Ollama?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ollama ([GitHub](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)) is an open-source platform that allows you to run large language models (LLMs) locally on your machine, supporting a variety of models including [Llama 3.1](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1) and [Mistral 7B](https://ollama.com/library/mistral). It optimizes setup and configuration by bundling model weights, configuration, and data into a single package defined by a Modelfile.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Langfuse?\n",
    "\n",
    "Langfuse ([GitHub](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse)) is an open-source LLM engineering platform that helps teams collaboratively debug, analyze, and iterate on their LLM applications via tracing, prompt management and evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local Deployment of Langfuse\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you can also locally deploy Langfuse to run models and trace LLM outputs only on your own device. [Here](https://langfuse.com/docs/deployment/local) is a guide on how to run Langfuse on your local machine using Docker Compose. This method is ideal for testing Langfuse and troubleshooting integration issues.\n",

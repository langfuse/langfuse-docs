        "Generating structured data from unstructured inputs is a core AI use case today. Structured outputs make especially chained LLM calls, UI component generation, and model-based evaluation more reliable. [Structured Outputs](https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/) is a new capability of the OpenAI API that builds upon JSON mode and function calling to enforce a strict schema in a model output.\n",

        "If you use the OpenAI Python SDK, you can use the [Langfuse drop-in replacement](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/openai/python/get-started) to get full logging by changing only the import. With that, you can monitor the structured output generated by OpenAI in Langfuse.\n",

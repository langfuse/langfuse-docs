    "This notebook provides a step-by-step guide on integrating **Langfuse** with **Semantic Kernel** to achieve observability and debugging for your LLM applications. By following this tutorial, you will learn how to trace your Semantic Kernel applications using Langfuse, manage your prompts in one place and evaluate your application to make it production ready.\n",

    "> **What is Semantic Kernel?** [Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel)) is a powerful open-source SDK from Microsoft. It facilitates the combination of LLMs with popular programming languages like C#, Python, and Java. Semantic Kernel empowers developers to build sophisticated AI applications by seamlessly integrating AI services, data sources, and custom logic, accelerating the delivery of enterprise-grade AI solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What is Langfuse?** [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is an open-source platform dedicated to LLM observability. It offers robust tracing and monitoring capabilities tailored for AI applications. Langfuse helps developers debug, analyze, and optimize their AI systems by providing detailed insights and integrating with a wide array of tools and frameworks through native integrations, OpenTelemetry, and dedicated SDKs.\n",

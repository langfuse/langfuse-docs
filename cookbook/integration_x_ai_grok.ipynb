Key features of Langfuse include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Tracing**: Allows you to track the flow of requests through your application, helping you understand how different components interact.\n",
      "- **Metrics**: Provides quantitative data on the performance of your LLM, such as latency, throughput, and error rates.\n",
      "- **Logs**: Captures detailed logs of interactions with the LLM, which can be invaluable for debugging and understanding model behavior.\n",
      "- **Analytics**: Offers analytics to help you optimize your application based on real usage data.\n",

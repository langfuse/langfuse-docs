    "# Observability and Tracing for the Vercel AI SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to **integrate Langfuse** with the **Vercel AI SDK** to monitor, debug, and evaluate your LLM-powered applications and AI agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What is the Vercel AI SDK?**: The [Vercel AI SDK](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-sdk) is a lightweight toolkit that lets developers call and stream responses from AI models (like OpenAI, Anthropic, or any compliant provider) directly in web apps with simple server/client functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What is Langfuse?**: [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) is an open-source observability platform for AI agents and LLM applications. It helps you visualize and monitor LLM calls, tool usage, cost, latency, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How do they work together?** The Vercel AI SDK has built-in telemetry based on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/). Langfuse also uses OpenTelemetry, which means they integrate seamlessly. When you enable telemetry in the Vercel AI SDK and add the Langfuse span processor, your AI calls automatically flow into Langfuse where you can analyze them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to integrate Langfuse with the Vercel AI SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "### TL;DR\n",
    "Here's the flow of how Langfuse and the Vercel AI SDK work together:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You enable telemetry** in the AI SDK (`experimental_telemetry: { isEnabled: true }`)\n",
    "2. **The AI SDK creates spans** for each operation (model calls, tool executions, etc.)\n",
    "3. **The LangfuseSpanProcessor intercepts** these spans and sends them to Langfuse\n",
    "4. **Langfuse stores and visualizes** the data in traces you can explore\n",
    "\n",
    "This integration uses [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/), an observability standard. The Vercel AI SDK's telemetry feature is documented in the [Vercel AI SDK documentation on Telemetry](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-core/telemetry).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through the steps in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "<Steps>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Install Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the Vercel AI SDK, OpenTelemetry, and Langfuse:\n",

    "<Callout type=\"info\">\n",

    "  },\n",

    "## Setup with Next.js\n",
    "\n",
    "For production Next.js applications, you'll need a few additional configurations to handle streaming responses properly and ensure traces are sent before serverless functions terminate.\n",

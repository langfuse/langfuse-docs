# Are read-only API keys available in Langfuse?

<!-- Please replace this placeholder content with the actual information from your screenshot -->

Currently, Langfuse API keys provide full access to your project data. However, you can control access permissions at the project level through role-based access control.

## Current API Key Capabilities

All API keys generated in Langfuse have the same permissions as the user who created them, including:
- Read access to all traces, sessions, and analytics
- Write access to create new traces and observations
- Modify project settings (depending on user role)

## Workarounds for Read-Only Access

While dedicated read-only API keys are not currently available, you can achieve similar functionality by:

1. **Project-level permissions**: Invite users with read-only roles to your project
2. **Separate projects**: Create a dedicated project for read-only access and selectively sync data
3. **API proxy**: Implement a custom proxy that filters write operations

## Feature Request

If you need read-only API keys, please upvote or comment on the relevant GitHub issue to help prioritize this feature.

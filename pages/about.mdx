Langfuse is building the open source LLM engineering platform to help teams build production-grade LLM applications faster (**[Why Langfuse?](/why)**).

We are excited about the potential of LLMs and generative AI and the impacts it will have on all of us. Doing our part in accelerating this shift is our mission.

We initially realized the pains of solving problems with LLMs during Y Combinator's W23 batch in San Francisco. We now have two offices, a larger one in Berlin, Germany (with a focus on product & engineering) and a smaller one in San Francisco (with a focus on marketing & sales). We hire product & engineering remotely across Europe, requiring one week in Berlin per month to continue building a strong culture. Travel & accomodation paid by us.
Since January 2026, we are part of Clickhouse to accelerate even further - [why we joined Clickhouse](/blog/joining-clickhouse).

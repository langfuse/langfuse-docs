# About us

Langfuse is building the open source LLM engineering platform to help teams build production-grade LLM applications faster (**[Why Langfuse?](/why)**).

We are extremely excited about the potential of LLMs and generative AI and the impacts it will have on all of us. While we initially realized the pains of solving problems with LLMs during Y Combinator's W23 batch in San Francisco, we currently work from Berlin, Germany.

Learn more about [why we started Langfuse](/blog/announcing-our-seed-round) and [where we are headed](/blog/2024-04-introducing-langfuse-2.0) on our blog.

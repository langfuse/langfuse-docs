# Module 1: Application & Agent Architectures

Designing an LLM application is **not** just about picking a modelâ€”it's about picking (and often combining) the _right architecture pattern_ along a spectrum that runs from a single LLM call to fully-autonomous multi-agent swarms.

## Architecture Patterns

The following tables provide an overview of common architecture patterns. We distinguish between deterministic workflow patterns and more flexible agentic patterns.

### Workflow patterns

These workflows show a **deterministic path** that is easy to reason about and debug.

| Pattern               | Essence                                                                                             | When it shines                                                            | Typical examples                                                                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prompt Chaining**   | Pipe the output of one LLM call straight into the next to decompose a task into fixed steps.        | Any job that naturally breaks into a "step 1 â†’ step 2 â†’ step 3" script.   | Outline â†’ validate â†’ draft a document; multi-stage data ETL.                             |
| **Routing / Handoff** | A "router" LLM first classifies the request, then hands it to a specialised prompt / model / agent. | Heterogeneous traffic where different skills or price-points are optimal. | Customer-support triage, tiered model stacks (cheap vs. premium), content-type dispatch. |
| **Parallelisation**   | Split independent subtasks or multiple perspectives, run them concurrently, then aggregate.         | Latency-sensitive work or problems that benefit from diversity / voting.  | RAG with query splits, document section summaries, "best-of-N" idea generation.          |

### Agentic patterns

These patterns show a **model-driven path** that is more flexible and can adapt to changing circumstances.

| Pattern                              | Essence                                                                                                                                      | When it shines                                                          | Typical examples                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reflection (Evaluator-Optimiser)** | The model critiques its own output and iterates until criteria are metâ€”generation â†’ self-assessment â†’ refine loop.                           | Quality-critical tasks where first drafts often miss the mark.          | Code that compiles & passes tests, self-RAG answer checking, polished writing.                                       |
| **Tool Use (Function Calling)**      | The LLM decides to invoke external functions/APIs, receives the results, then writes the final answer.                                       | Anything needing fresh data, side-effects, or capabilities beyond text. | Calendar booking, database look-ups, smart-home control, code execution.                                             |
| **Planning (Orchestrator-Workers)**  | A planner LLM dynamically drafts a multi-step plan, delegates subtasks to worker agents, and synthesises the results, re-planning if needed. | Open-ended, multi-phase goals where steps are unknown until you start.  | Feature implementation pipelines, research reports, multi-modal creative projects.                                   |
| **Multi-Agent Collaboration**        | Multiple agents with distinct roles/personas/toolsets coordinateâ€”via a manager or peer-to-peerâ€”to reach a shared goal.                       | Complex, multifaceted problems that mirror real-world teams or debates. | Software project teams (PM, coder, tester), debate simulators, collaborative story writing, scientific "lab" agents. |

## How to pick the right pattern

1. **Start simple.** If you can pre-write the steps, a workflow pattern is faster, cheaper, and easier to debug.
2. **Add autonomy only for uncertainty.** Shift to Reflection, Planning, or Multi-Agent once the task demands dynamic decision-making or parallel specialisation.
3. **Combine patterns pragmatically.** Real systems often nest these blocks: e.g., a Planning agent that assigns Tool-Using workers and then reflects on their outputs.

This choice introduces a **trade-off between predictability and agency**: the higher you climb, the more freedom your system gains, but the harder it becomes to anticipate or constrain every step.

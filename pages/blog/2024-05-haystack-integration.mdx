We're excited to highlight a new Langfuse integration with Haystack!

This integration allows you to easily trace your Haystack pipelines in the Langfuse UI. We've previously launched integrations with popular tools that devs love -- including [LlamaIndex](/blog/llama-index-integration), [LangChain](/docs/integrations/langchain/tracing) and [LiteLLM](/docs/integrations/litellm) -- and we're excited to be continuing that with Haystack.

Thanks to the team at deepset for developing the integration. We're excited to see how you use it!

## What's New

The `langfuse-haystack` package integrates tracing capabilities into Haystack (2.x) pipelines using Langfuse. You can then add `LangfuseConnector` as a tracer to automatically trace the operations and data flow within the pipeline.

## What is Haystack?

[Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) is the open-source Python framework developed by deepset. Its modular design allows users to implement custom pipelines to build production-ready LLM applications, like retrieval-augmented generative (RAG) pipelines and state-of-the-art search systems. It integrates with Hugging Face Transformers, Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic and others, making it an extremely popular framework for teams of all sizes.

**RAG has proven to be a pragmatic and efficient way of working with LLMs**. The integration of custom data sources through RAG can significantly enhance the quality of an LLM’s response, improving user experience. Haystack is a lightweight and powerful tool to build data-augmented LLM applications; you can read more about their approach to the building blocks of pipelines [here](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/intro).

Haytsack recently introduced Haystack 2.0 with a new architecture and modular design. Building on top of Haystack makes applications easier to understand, maintain and extend.

## How Can Langfuse Help?

[Langfuse tracing](/docs/tracing) can be helpful for Haystack pipelines in the following ways:

- Capture comprehensive details of each execution trace in a beautiful UI dashboard
  - Latency
  - Token usage
  - Cost
  - Scores
- Capture the full context of the execution
- Monitor and score traces
- Build fine-tuning and testing datasets

Langfuse integration with a tool like Haystack can help monitor model performance, can assist with pinpointing areas for improvement, or create datasets from your pipeline executions for fine-tuning and testing.

## Quickstart

Here are the steps to get started! First, add your API keys. You can find your Langfuse public and private keys on the dashboard. Make sure to set `HAYSTACK_CONTENT_TRACING_ENABLED` to `"True"`.

```python
import os

# Get keys for your project from the project settings page
# https://cloud.langfuse.com
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇪🇺 EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇺🇸 US region
os.environ["HAYSTACK_CONTENT_TRACING_ENABLED"] = "True"

# Your openai key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-proj-..."
```

Here's how you add `LangfuseConnector` as a tracer to the pipeline:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from haystack import Document, Pipeline
from haystack.components.builders import PromptBuilder
from haystack.components.embedders import SentenceTransformersDocumentEmbedder, SentenceTransformersTextEmbedder
from haystack.components.generators import OpenAIGenerator
from haystack.components.retrievers import InMemoryEmbeddingRetriever
from haystack.document_stores.in_memory import InMemoryDocumentStore
from haystack_integrations.components.connectors.langfuse import LangfuseConnector

basic_rag_pipeline = Pipeline()
    # Add components to your pipeline
    basic_rag_pipeline.add_component("tracer", LangfuseConnector("Basic RAG Pipeline"))
    basic_rag_pipeline.add_component(
        "text_embedder", SentenceTransformersTextEmbedder(model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
    )
    basic_rag_pipeline.add_component("retriever", retriever)
    basic_rag_pipeline.add_component("prompt_builder", prompt_builder)
    basic_rag_pipeline.add_component("llm", OpenAIGenerator(model="gpt-4o", generation_kwargs={"n": 2}))
```

For each trace, you can see:

- Latency for each component of the pipeline
- Input and output for each step
- For generations, token usage and costs are automatically calculated.

If you want to learn more about traces and what they can do in Langfuse, read our [documentation](/docs/tracing).

## Join us for Fall Launch Week

We are thrilled to announce **Langfuse's Fall Launch Week**! Starting on **Sunday, November 17, 2024**, we'll unveil a major upgrade to the Langfuse platform **every day until Friday**.

We're focusing on expanding support for new model capabilities and enhancing how Langfuse seamlessly integrates into your development workflow, empowering you to build more robust and versatile AI applications.

- ⭐️ [Star us](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/) on GitHub & see _all_ of our releases!
- [Twitter](https://x.com/langfuse) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/langfuse/) will be our main channels for all of Launch Week.
- Join our [virtual community session](https://lu.ma/c7zsbc3b) on Wednesday.

## Launches

### Day 0: Vercel AI SDK Integration

```ts /import { observeVercelAI } from "langfuse"/ /observeVercelAI/
import { AI } from "@vercel/sdk";
import { observeVercelAI } from "langfuse";

// Wrap the Vercel AI SDK
const ai = observeVercelAI(new AI());

// Use the Vercel AI SDK as you normally would
const response = await ai.generate({
  messages: [{ role: "system", content: "Tell me a story." }],
});
```

We are excited to announce the integration of the **Vercel AI SDK** with Langfuse. This integration enables developers to easily monitor and observe applications built with the Vercel AI SDK, bringing enhanced capabilities to your development loop and supporting a wider range of models and frameworks.

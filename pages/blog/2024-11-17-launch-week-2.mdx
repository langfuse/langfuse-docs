This week, we're focusing on **supporting the next generation of models**. As AI models evolve to process diverse data types like text, images, and audio, Langfuse is evolving too. We're introducing features that allow seamless integration and monitoring of multi-modal models, giving you deeper observability and control.

Additionally, we're integrating Langfuse deeply into your development loop with **end-to-end prompt engineering workflow tooling** tailored for product development teams. This empowers your team to efficiently design, test, and deploy models and prompts within a streamlined workflow, enhancing collaboration and accelerating the development of AI features.

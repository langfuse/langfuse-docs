We are excited to announce **Langfuse Launch Week #2**!

Starting on **Monday, November 18th, 2024**, we'll unveil a major upgrade to the Langfuse platform **every day until Friday**. We're topping it off with a [Product Hunt launch](/ph) on Friday and a [Virtual Town Hall](https://lu.ma/c7zsbc3b) on Wednesday.

[Star us](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/) on GitHub and follow us on [Twitter](https://x.com/langfuse) for daily updates.

This week, we're focusing on **supporting the next generation of models**. As AI models evolve Langfuse is evolving too. We're integrating Langfuse deeply into your development loop with **end-to-end prompt engineering workflow tooling** tailored for product development teams. Stay tuned for the exciting updates ahead!

## Launches

### üöÄ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 0: Prompt Management for Vercel AI SDK

```typescript {11,13,15}
import { generateText } from "ai";
import { Langfuse } from "langfuse";

const langfuse = new Langfuse();

// fetch prompt from Langfuse Prompt Management
const fetchedPrompt = await langfuse.getPrompt("my-prompt");

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  prompt: fetchedPrompt.prompt, // use prompt
  experimental_telemetry: {
    isEnabled: true, // enable tracing
    metadata: {
      langfusePrompt: fetchedPrompt.toJSON(), // link trace to prompt version
    },
  },
});
```

Langfuse Prompt Management now integrates natively with the Vercel AI SDK. Version and release prompts in Langfuse, use them via Vercel AI SDK, monitor metrics in Langfuse.

This helps you answer questions like:

- _Which prompt version caused a particular bug?_
- _What is the average latency and cost impact of a prompt version?_
- _Which prompt version is the most used?_

See the [changelog](/changelog/2024-11-17-vercel-ai-sdk-prompt-mgmt) for more details.

### ‚öñÔ∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 2: Dataset Experiment Run Comparison View

Langfuse Datasets now features a powerful comparison view for dataset experiment runs. This new interface allows both technical and non-technical users to analyze multiple experiment runs side by side. Compare your application's performance across different test dataset experiment runs, examine metrics like latency and cost, and dive deep into individual dataset items. Perfect for teams iterating on their ML applications with different prompts, models, or parameters.

See the [changelog](/changelog/2024-11-18-dataset-runs-comparison-view) for more details.

AI-driven research is evolving fast. While OpenAI has introduced Deep Research recently, open-source alternatives are just as exciting. In this post, we take a closer look at the inner workings of open [deep-research](https://github.com/dzhng/deep-research) by David Zhang ([dzhng](https://github.com/dzhng))—a lightweight, transparent framework for iterative AI research.

At under 500 lines of code, `deep-research` packs a surprising punch. It runs recursive research loops, refining queries based on the information it finds—no hidden logic, no unnecessary dependencies, just a clean, modular setup that’s easy to hack or extend.

We decided to put it to the test. With [Langfuse](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse), we traced its execution (thanks to [@hassiebp](https://github.com/hassiebp) for building the [integration](https://github.com/hassiebp/deep-research-with-langfuse)), broke down its decision-making, and measured performance. Below, we’ll show how it works, why it’s worth a look, and how it compares to other AI research tools.

## Why We Like This Agent

- **Simple** – Minimalist design, easy to modify, and fully open-source.  
- **Iterative Research** – Runs deep research loops, refining its queries at each step.  
- **Control Depth & Breadth** – Users define how far (depth) and wide (breadth) the research should go.  
- **Parallel Execution** – Fires off multiple queries at once, speeding up research.

**Tech Stack**:
- **o3-mini** as the language model for SERP generation, learnings, and the final report.  
- **Firecrawl** for executing SERP queries.

Despite its minimal footprint, the framework is robust enough to generate meaningful follow-up questions, refine its search, and compile a structured final report. This simplicity makes it an approachable playground for anyone looking to experiment with or build upon an iterative AI research agent.

## How the Execution Looks in Langfuse

To see how `deep-research` holds up, we asked it a more nuanced question:

> "I don't get how Whisper is fully open source (MIT), yet ChatGPT's speech-to-text is vastly better than Perplexity's and Apple's. Can you help me figure this out?"

This isn’t a simple fact lookup—it requires synthesizing multiple sources, filtering insights, and producing structured responses.

With a breadth of 4 and a depth of 2, for instance, we might see the agent generate multiple parallel queries—and then refine those queries after it sees what the search turned up. You’d end up with a thorough markdown report summarizing everything, plus any missing links the agent found intriguing.

Each iteration of this loop can be viewed as an event within Langfuse. Tracking these events provides a step-by-step replay of the agent’s logic—useful for debugging and fine-tuning. Here’s the public trace in Langfuse:

*Note: The chart above is a Gantt-like overview of query processes.*

Next, let’s break down each step of the research loop in more detail.

<Steps>

### 1. Initial Query
The system message and user prompt are created. This is where the agent sets the context.

  ![Initial Query](/images/blog/2025-02-20-the-agent-deep-dive-open-deep-research/system-prompt.png)
</Frame>

### 2. Follow-Up Questions
The agent proposes up to three follow-up questions based on the initial prompt.

</Frame>

### 3. Search Queries
Based on those follow-up questions, the agent generates SERP queries to investigate the topic further.

  ![Search Queries](/images/blog/2025-02-20-the-agent-deep-dive-open-deep-research/serp-queries.png)
</Frame>

### 4. Search Engine Calls
The system then spawns multiple queries to a search API (in this case, Firecrawl).

</Frame>

### 5. Learnings from the Content
After retrieving the search results, the agent processes them and generates up to three “learnings” (insights). It also proposes new follow-up questions, continuing the loop if necessary.

</Frame>

### 6. Markdown Report
Finally, once the maximum research breadth (e.g., 4) and depth (e.g., 2) are reached, the agent compiles a Markdown report summarizing key findings. It uses all the intermediate “learnings” from previous steps to form a coherent answer.

</Steps>

All these steps are tracked in Langfuse—timestamps, search calls, LLM calls, and final outputs—providing a transparent view of how the agent arrives at its answer.

## Comparison With Other AI Research Tools

Although `deep-research` is a small, open-source project, we wanted to see how it fares alongside two well-known AI tools: OpenAI’s ChatGPT (with advanced research features or higher usage tiers) and Perplexity Pro.

To keep it fair, we ran the **same** question on all three:

### David Zhang’s Open Deep Research
- **Time to finish**: ~3 minutes and 34 seconds  
- **Estimated model usage cost**: ~$0.71  
- **Generated report length**: ~12k characters  
- **Trace**: [Langfuse Link](https://cloud.langfuse.com/project/cm6y5qfi901bzad07tyaeg3no/traces/fd9be9b8-ffd2-435b-ba90-45a0af649954)

### OpenAI’s Deep Research
- **Time to finish**: ~6 minutes  
- **Insights**: ~27 sources  
- **Generated report length**: ~87k characters  
- **Costs**: Hard to pin down exactly; it likely depends on o3 and crawler usage.
- **Example link**: [OpenAI Example Thread](https://chatgpt.com/share/67aa55e9-1cb4-8009-a3c1-69607e6ca1cd)

### Perplexity Pro Deep Research
- **Time to finish**: ~3 minutes  
- **Insights**: ~49 sources  
- **Report length**: ~8k characters  
- **Link to Perplexity Thread**: [Perplexity Deep Research Example](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/i-don-t-get-how-whisper-is-ful-Uuq8BQh8SyOOkAuOeG0j_Q)

**Takeaways**:  
- `deep-research` is impressively agile for a lean, open-source tool.  
- Perplexity’s product can pull in a larger number of sources quickly, leveraging its specialization on web search.  
- OpenAI’s Deep Research generated a very long report and leveraged more sources—potentially drawing on internal fine-tuning or advanced system prompts.

Ultimately, if you want transparency, low cost, and hackability, David Zhang’s `deep-research` stands out. If you need huge reports or integrated browsing at scale, you may prefer a more mature commercial solution.

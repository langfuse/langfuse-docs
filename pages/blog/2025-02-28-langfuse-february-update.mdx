We’ve had a busy February at Langfuse, filled with new integrations, features, and announcements. Here’s a quick rundown:

## 🔭 OpenTelemetry Support

</Frame>

Langfuse now includes an OpenTelemetry backend to receive OTel traces at: `/api/public/otel`

> **What is OpenTelemetry?**  
> [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is an open-source observability framework for collecting and processing telemetry data. It includes Semantic Conventions, which standardize the naming and structuring of trace data.

We’re thrilled about this update because it enables integrations with a wide range of frameworks and languages that use the OpenTelemetry standard. This includes:

* [CrewAI](/docs/integrations/crewai)  
* [AutoGen](/docs/integrations/autogen)  
* [Semantic Kernel](/docs/integrations/semantic-kernel)  
* [Pydantic AI](/docs/integrations/pydantic-ai)  
* [Spring AI](/docs/integrations/spring-ai)  
* [Smolagents](/docs/integrations/smolagents)  
* Other languages such as Java, Go, .NET

→ Learn more in our [documentation](/docs/opentelemetry/get-started)

## ⚡ Open Source LLMOps Stack

</Frame>
We've partnered with [LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/) to introduce the Open Source LLMOps Stack.

Selecting the right tooling stack is essential—avoiding vendor lock-in and high switching costs means you can continue to develop in rapid cycles.

Popular among Langfuse and LiteLLM users (especially in enterprise and regulated settings), this stack enables efficient observability without extensive instrumentation. LiteLLM further enhances the experience with virtual LLM keys, budgeting, failovers, and compatibility with over 100 LLMs through the OpenAI API schema.

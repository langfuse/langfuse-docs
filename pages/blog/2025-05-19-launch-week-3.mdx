## 🔎&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day&nbsp;1: Full text search

  title="Full Text Search Tutorial"
  frameBorder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  className="aspect-video rounded border mt-6"
  allowFullScreen
></iframe>

This feature has received one of the highest numbers of upvotes in our [feature requests](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/939), and we are thrilled to make it available. Finding all occurrences of a specific keyword or phrase across your Langfuse traces and observations can be extremely helpful.

See the video above for a quick tutorial.

## 📌&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day&nbsp;2: Save and share table views

></iframe>

Save your most-used table configurations and instantly share them with teammates. Create custom views for different workflows—like filtering for failed traces or high-cost runs — and access them with a single click. Every saved view gets a unique permalink, making it easy to collaborate viewing the same data without having to recreate complex filters and sorting.

Available across all major tables in Langfuse: Traces, Observations, Scores, Sessions, and Datasets.

We are excited to announce **Langfuse Launch Week #3**!

Starting on **Monday, May 19&nbsp;–&nbsp;Saturday, May&nbsp;24, 2025**, we'll drop a fresh feature **every single day**. Expect to get deeper insights from your application data, more guidance on how to get started, improve and evaluate your LLM applications, and more ways to integrate with your favorite tools and frameworks.

We'll celebrate with a mid-week [Virtual Community Hour](https://lu.ma/1q57o5ok) and our third [Product Hunt launch](/ph).

[Star us](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/) on GitHub and follow us on [Twitter](https://x.com/langfuse) so you don't miss an announcement.

Save your most-used table configurations and instantly share them with teammates. Create custom views for different workflows—like filtering for failed traces or high-cost runs — and access them with a single click. Every saved view gets a unique permalink, making it easy to collaborate viewing the same data without having to recreate complex filters and sorting.

Available across all major tables in Langfuse: Traces, Observations, Scores, Sessions, and Datasets.

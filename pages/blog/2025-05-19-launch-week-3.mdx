This feature has received one of the highest numbers of upvotes in our [feature requests](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/939), and we are thrilled to make it available. Finding all occurrences of a specific keyword or phrase across your Langfuse traces and observations can be extremely helpful.

See the video above for a quick tutorial.

### 📌&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day&nbsp;2: Save and share table views

Save your most-used table configurations and instantly share them with teammates. Create custom views for different workflows—like filtering for failed traces or high-cost runs — and access them with a single click. Every saved view gets a unique permalink, making it easy to collaborate viewing the same data without having to recreate complex filters and sorting.

Available across all major tables in Langfuse: Traces, Observations, Scores, Sessions, and Datasets.

Deploy Langfuse on your own infrastructure in minutes using our new Terraform modules for **AWS**, **GCP**, and **Azure**. The modules provision everything you need—networking, databases, storage, and a production-ready Kubernetes cluster—so you can focus on building, not managing infrastructure.

### 🔭&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day&nbsp;5: OTEL-based Python SDK&nbsp;(beta)

  allowFullScreen
></iframe>

Meet the next generation **Langfuse Python SDK** built on the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) standard! This big update simplifies tracing with unified context propagation that automatically nests operations, even across threads or async tasks. Instrument your code using three flexible styles: the `@observe` decorator, context managers, or manual observations, which can be mixed and matched.

The SDK ships today in **public beta** (pip install `langfuse>=3.0.0b2`). We can't wait to hear your feedback!

### 📐 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day&nbsp;6: Langfuse Evaluator Library

Making LLM evaluation easier, more powerful, and production-ready is now possible with the new Langfuse Evaluator Library that includes more prebuilt templates. It ships with **RAGAS evaluators** (context relevance, goal accuracy, SQL semantic equivalence, and more), Langfuse-managed evaluators, and the ability to build custom ones.

In addition, we've revamped the setup flow when creating a new eval to make it easier to get started and understand how the different configurations work.

**May&nbsp;2025** was our most action-packed month yet at Langfuse. We welcomed thousands of new users, powered through countless lines of code, wrapped our third Launch Week, shipped long-awaited API goodies, and rolled out a handful of fresh integrations.

## üî≠ Python SDK v3 is now Generally Available

Following extensive testing and community feedback, we're excited to announce that **Langfuse Python SDK&nbsp;v3 is now generally available** and ready for production use.

**Why you'll love it:**

- **Unified context propagation:** Automatically nests spans and generations, even across threads or async tasks.
- **Simple & Flexible Instrumentation:** Use the `@observe` decorator, context managers, or manual observations. Mix and match as you like.
- **Ecosystem Integration:** Works out-of-the-box with OTel-instrumented libraries like MLflow, OpenLit, and more ‚Äì covering the long-tail of model and agent SDKs much better.
- **Global Client Access:** Easily fetch the initialized Langfuse client anywhere in your project via `get_client()`.
- üïπÔ∏è **Get started now:** `pip install langfuse`

In a new blog post, Steffen walks through the product thinking and architecture behind our most-requested feature of Launch Week: **Custom Dashboards**.

You'll see how a **virtual data model** decouples the UI from ClickHouse, how the query builder assembles complex charts in milliseconds, and why reusable widgets make collaboration a breeze.

‚Üí If you're curious about the trade-offs that let dashboards stay flexible **and** fast, even on billions of rows, give the [post a read](/blog/2025-05-21-customizable-dashboards).

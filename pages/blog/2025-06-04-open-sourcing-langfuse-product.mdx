The LLM landscape is changing rapidly and so are the workflows used to build and improve LLM apps. Today, **we are open sourcing all Product Features in Langfuse** to enable our community to iterate on their applications faster and provide our project with feedback on where to go next.

Newly open sourced features include managed [LLM-as-a-judge evaluations](/docs/scores/model-based-evals), [annotation queues](/docs/scores/annotation), [prompt experiments](/docs/datasets/prompt-experiments) and [the playground](/docs/playground), all of which are now freely available to self-host under the MIT license.

_If you are self-hosting Langfuse already today, **upgrade your deployment to the [latest version](/self-hosting/upgrade)**. You will find a more powerful version of Langfuse._

## Why are we doing this?

Langfuse is building the **open source LLM Engineering Platform**. We are building _the_ platform to observe and improve LLM applications.

We are constantly shipping to be the technology of choice for our community. This requires trust, feedback and buy-in from our community.

We re-visited the gated features in our Enterprise Edition. If we want to be the first choice in the market, we need to allow our community to **cover the entire dev cycle in our FOSS version**. Features like LLM-as-a-Judge, Evals, or our Playground are market standard at this point and should be freely available. **But why stop there?**

The best platform for developers has to be open at its core. By **removing commercial barriers from our product features**, we're fostering deeper trust, collaborating on contributions, accelerating adoption, gathering richer community feedback, and iterating faster than ever.

## Our Open Source Journey

**Langfuse was [launched](/blog/product-analytics-for-LLM-apps) as an open source project.** This was based on a few [core beliefs](/why):

- Data captured by Langfuse should be freely accessible
- The AI landscape changes every week â€“ Langfuse must integrate agnostically with all models and application stacks
- Great teams deserve the flexibility to extend the platform to support custom workflows

**This positioning resonates and today we are doubling down on it.**

Langfuse has been an open core company from the start. **Our core just expanded significantly** and our periphery shrunk. Commercially licensed code is now limited to features for Enterprise Security and Platform Teams (e.g. SCIM, Audit Logs, Data Retention Policies â€“ regular [SSO](/self-hosting/security/authentication-and-sso) is and continues to be MIT licensed).

### Langfuse's Open Core Model

| Area                       | Then       | Now           |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Core Platform              | OSS (MIT)  | OSS (MIT) âœ…  |
| LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluations | Commercial | OSS (MIT) âœ…  |
| Playground                 | Commercial | OSS (MIT) âœ…  |
| Prompt Experiments         | Commercial | OSS (MIT) âœ…  |
| Annotation/Data Labeling   | Commercial | OSS (MIT) âœ…  |
| Enterprise Security        | Commercial | Commercial ðŸ”’ |
| Enterprise Support         | Commercial | Commercial ðŸ”’ |

As we open source previously commercial features, we are fully investing our commercial focus in Langfuse Cloud and Enterprise platform teams in self-hosting.

## Thousands of Langfuse Deployments

Besides >7,000,000 monthly SDK installs and >5,500,000 Docker pulls, there are >8,000 monthly active self-hosted instances of Langfuse out in the wild. This boggles our minds.

We expect that today's changes solidify Langfuse as the first choice for a powerful and truly open source platform in LLMOps.

Today is the day to start self-hosting Langfuse. Head over to [our self hosting docs](/self-hosting) and use the new [terraform modules](/changelog/2025-05-22-terraform-modules) for deploying Langfuse at production-scale.

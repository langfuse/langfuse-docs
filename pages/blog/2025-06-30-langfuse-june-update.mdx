June was busy at **Langfuse**: We lowered prices across every Cloud plan, delivered long-awaited features, grew the team, and opened new roles.

_Missed it? **Langfuse Python SDK v3** is now generally available and ready for production use ([upgrade guide](/docs/sdk/python/sdk-v3#upgrade-from-v2))._

## ðŸ’¸ Prices down on every Langfuse Cloud plan

  ![Pricing Update Placeholder](/images/blog/2025-06-30-langfuse-june-update/pricing.png)
</Frame>

We've **reduced usage-based pricing across the board** and introduced automatic volume discounts on tracing units. You save more as you grow; no action needed.

## ðŸ“‚ Organize prompts with folders

<Frame className="rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
  ![Prompt Folders Placeholder](/images/blog/2025-06-30-langfuse-june-update/prompt-folders.png)
</Frame>

Keep your prompt library tidy by adding **folders** directly in the prompt name:

```text
production/email_welcome
```

Anything before the "/" becomes a folder. Organize by use-case, model, or teamâ€”no more endless scroll.

## ðŸ¤– Agentic Onboarding (Beta)

<Frame className="rounded-lg overflow-hidden">

Add Langfuse to agents like **Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf** via our new MPC endpoint. It's experimental, and we'd love your feedback.

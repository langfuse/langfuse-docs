June was busy at Langfuse: We lowered prices across every Cloud plan thanks to some infrastructure improvements (we‚Äôre excited to share these economies of scale with you), added several highly requested features to the new Dashboards and Prompt Management, and made onboarding even faster.

_Missed it? **Langfuse Python SDK v3** is now generally available and ready for production use ([upgrade guide](/docs/sdk/python/sdk-v3#upgrade-from-v2))._

## üí∏ Prices down on every Langfuse Cloud plan

<Frame className="rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
  ![Pricing Update Placeholder](/images/blog/2025-06-30-langfuse-june-update/pricing.png)
</Frame>

We've **reduced usage-based pricing across the board** and introduced automatic volume discounts on tracing units. You save more as you grow; no action needed.

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Pivot Tables in Custom Dashboards

<Frame className="rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
  ![Pivot Tables Placeholder](/images/blog/2025-06-30-langfuse-june-update/pivot-tables.png)
</Frame>

Big upgrade to custom dashboards in Langfuse. The new pivot table widget lets you analyze multi-dimensional data, making it easier to uncover patterns and insights across different segments and metrics.

‚Üí See [changelog](/changelog/2025-07-01-pivot-tables-custom-dashboards)
 
By the way, we have also added [histograms](/changelog/2025-06-30-histogram-charts-custom-dashboards) to help you plot the distribution of metrics.

## üß© Message placeholders in prompts

<Frame className="rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
  ![Message Placeholders Placeholder](/images/blog/2025-06-30-langfuse-june-update/message-placeholders.png)
</Frame>

This is a much-requested improvement to Prompt Management that allows you to insert arrays of messages at any point within a Langfuse chat prompt. It is fully compatible with Langfuse Prompt Experiments and Playground.

‚Üí [Read the docs](/docs/prompt-management/features/message-placeholders)

## üìÇ Organize prompts with folders

<Frame className="rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
  ![Prompt Folders Placeholder](/images/blog/2025-06-30-langfuse-june-update/prompt-folders.png)
</Frame>

Keep your prompt library tidy by adding **folders** directly in the prompt name:

```text
production/email_welcome
```

Anything before the "/" becomes a folder. Organize by use-case, model, or team‚Äîno more endless scroll.

‚Üí [Read the docs](/docs/prompt-management/features/folders)

## ü§ñ Agentic Onboarding (Beta)

<Frame className="rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
  ![Agentic Onboarding Placeholder](/images/blog/2025-06-30-langfuse-june-update/agentic-onboarding.png)
</Frame>

Add Langfuse to agents like **Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf** via our new MPC endpoint. It's experimental, and we'd love your feedback.

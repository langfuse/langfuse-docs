This month, we've shipped updates to improve tracing for complex agents, enhance team collaboration, and expanded the integration library. Here's what's new:

## New Observation Types

<Frame className="rounded-lg overflow-hidden">

</Frame>

We've introduced new observation types to give you deeper insight into your agent's behavior. You can now semantically label spans as **Agent, Tool, Chain, Retriever, Embedding, and Guardrail**, making it easier to debug and analyze complex traces.

For most agent framework integrations, these types are detected automatically. You can also set them manually via the Langfuse Tracing SDKs.

## End-to-End Walkthrough Videos

We've released many new capabilities over recent months. We recorded four new short videos covering observability, prompt management, and evaluation to help you get up to speed quickly. Go check them out!

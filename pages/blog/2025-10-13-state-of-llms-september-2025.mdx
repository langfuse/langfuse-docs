## About this Report
Langfuse is the leading open source LLM observability platform powering safe and scalable LLM applications for 10s of thousands of organizations. The data on Langfuse Cloud tells a story of a rapidly growing market and allows us to get a unique view on the state of the LLM market.

**Definition of "Market Share":** 

We are looking at "Market Share" from application developers' perspective. Our data shows the adoption of models by developers who are building applications, not consumers that use those models via apps like Claude, Gemini or ChatGPT.

**Here is what we have analyzed:**
- **Billions of LLM traces and observations** ([see data model](/docs/observability/data-model)) on Langfuse Cloud (no self-hosted data included). 
- **59 unique models tracked across major providers**, longtail of models is not included and grouped into "Other"
- Our dataset is **biased to the Langfuse user base** and might diverge from actual market shares
- **Time Period:** 12 months (Oct 2024 - Sep 2025)

## Status Quo in September 2025

Here is where the market stands in September 2025: OpenAI is still the dominant player (55.3%), followed by Google (13.1%) and Anthropic (7.3%). The longtail of models is not included and grouped into "Other" (24.3%).

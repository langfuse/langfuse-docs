## About Langfuse
Langfuse is the [leading open source LLM observability platform](/blog/2024-11-most-used-oss-llmops) powering safe and scalable LLM applications for 10s of thousands of organizations. The data on Langfuse Cloud tells a story of a rapidly growing market and allows us to get a unique view on the state of the LLM application layer. 

We power global enterprises like [Khan Academy](/customers/khan-academy), [SumUp](/customers/sumup) and [Merck](/customers/merckgroup) as well as AI-native startups like [Magic Patterns](/customers/magic-patterns-ai-design-tools), [Circleback](https://circleback.ai/) and [Juicebox](https://juicebox.ai/) to build safe and scalable LLM applications and agents.

## About this Report
The core of what we do is helping developers to ship LLM applications and agents faster and more reliably. Our dataset gives a **unique view on how models are adopted on the application layer** instead of consumers that use those models via apps like Claude, Gemini or ChatGPT.

- The data comes from **over 20.000 organizations** on Langfuse Cloud
- **Billions of LLM traces and observations** ([see data model](/docs/observability/data-model)) on Langfuse Cloud (no self-hosted data included)
- **59 unique models tracked across major providers**, longtail of models is not included and grouped into "Other"
- **Time Period:** 12 months (Oct 2024 - Sep 2025)



## Status Quo in September 2025

Here is where the market stands in September 2025: OpenAI is still the dominant player (55.3%), followed by Google (13.1%) and Anthropic (7.3%). The longtail of models is not included and grouped into "Other" (24.3%).

| Provider | Sep 2025 | Oct 2024 | Change |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| OpenAI | 55.3% | 82.7% | -27.4 pts |
| Other | 24.3% | 10.0% | +14.3 pts |
| Google | 13.1% | 0.5% | +12.6 pts |
| Anthropic | 7.3% | 6.8% | +0.5 pts |

## Key Insights
- **OpenAI is yielding market share** (down -27.4 points) while Google, Anthropic and "Other" model providers grow.
- **Google's Rise:** Google went from 0.5% → 13.1% (26x) share in just 12 months.
- **Anthropic is relatively stable** at 7.3%
- **"Other" models rising** strongly signals that the LLM market is fragmenting beyond the "Big Three," with organizations adopting specialized models, open-source alternatives, and regional providers.


## Market Share by Model

Let's take a look at market shares on model level.

</Frame>

**What we see**
- The market is operating on a **~6 month effective model lifecycle** – Several October 2024 top-20 models effectively disappeared
- **Application builders are heavily relying on small efficient models** (OpenAI nano or mini: Gemini Flash; Anthropic’s Opus model not relevant) 
- The **story isn't "OpenAI vs everyone else"—it's fragmentation vs. consolidation**. While the Big Three (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) consolidate around 75% of tracked share, the "Other" 25% represents hundreds of specialized models serving specific use cases, geographies, or price points.

**Key Takeaways:** 
- **Organizations aren't building on stable platforms**; they're building on a constantly shifting foundation. This creates both opportunity (rapid innovation) and risk (technical debt accumulates fast).
- **Staying flexible and being ready to swap out models will pay off** when building applications and underlying infrastructure.

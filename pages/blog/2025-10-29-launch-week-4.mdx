It's back! Starting **Monday, November 3rd**, we're dropping a new feature every single day for five days.

### What to Expect?

This launch brings deeper agent insights from your agent applications, improved team collaboration, a big leap in experimentation/evaluation, and more ways to integrate with your favorite tools and frameworks.

We'll unwrap a new feature each day:

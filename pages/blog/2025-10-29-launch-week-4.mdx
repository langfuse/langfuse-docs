It's back! Starting **Monday, November 3rd**, we're dropping a new feature every single day for five days.

## All launches

This launch brings deeper agent insights from your agent applications, improved team collaboration, a big leap in experimentation/evaluation, and more ways to integrate with your favorite tools and frameworks.

We'll unwrap a new feature each day:

<Steps>

### Day 1: New Filters for Tables and API

Many users have millions of traces and observations. We've made it easier to filter and search for the data you need.

→ **Learn more about [filters in the UI](/changelog/2025-11-03-filter-sidebar-for-tables) and [in the API](/changelog/2025-11-03-advanced-filtering-traces-and-observations-api)**

### Day 2: Collaborate with your team directly in Langfuse

  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  className="aspect-video rounded border mt-6 max-w-xl"
  allowFullScreen
></iframe>

Comments now support @mentions and emoji reactions, making it easier to collaborate with your team directly in Langfuse. Tag teammates to bring their attention to specific sessions, traces, observations, or prompts, and use reactions to quickly acknowledge insights without adding another comment.

→ **Learn more about [comments](/changelog/2025-11-04-comment-mentions-and-reactions)**

We teamed up with Mixpanel to integrate LLM-related product metrics into your existing Mixpanel dashboards. This integration makes it easy to combine your regular product analytics with the LLM-specific metrics that Langfuse generates.

### Day 3: Langfuse for Agents

We’re introducing a set of upgrades to make complex agents radically easier to understand and debug: 

- **[Agent Tools](/changelog/2025-11-05-langfuse-for-agents#agent-tools)** now surface all tools available to the LLM at the top of each generation, with clickable definitions and a Chat UI that shows called tools, arguments, and call IDs aligned with the tools list so you can quickly verify the right ones were used. 
- A new **[Trace Log View](/changelog/2025-11-05-langfuse-for-agents#trace-log-view)** lets you skim every agent step in a single concatenated stream, making it easy to find specific details in loopy, verbose agents. 
- Expanded **[Observation Types](/changelog/2025-11-05-langfuse-for-agents#observation-types)** make it clear what each span represents, from tool calls to embeddings to agent steps. 
- And with **[Agent Graphs](/changelog/2025-11-05-langfuse-for-agents#agent-graphs-ga)** now Generally Available for any framework or custom instrumentation, we infer graph structure from observation timings and nesting to visualize the real execution flow of your agents, especially in complex, looping scenarios.

We also added a new [guide](/guides/cookbook/example_pydantic_ai_mcp_agent_evaluation) on how to evaluate LLM agents and their tools with Langfuse.

### Day 4: Experiments in Langfuse

  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  className="aspect-video rounded border mt-6 max-w-xl"
  allowFullScreen
></iframe>

We're adding a set of new features to Dataset Experiments in Langfuse:

- **[Annotations in Compare View](/changelog/2025-10-23-annotate-from-compare-view)** to scores and comments directly alongside experiment results.

- **[Baseline Comparison](/changelog/2025-11-06-compare-view-baseline-support)** to set a specific run as a baseline to identify regressions in newer runs.

- **[Compare View Filters](/changelog/2025-11-07-compare-view-filters)** to filter experiment results based on criteria, such as evaluator scores.

- **[Experiment Runner SDK](/changelog/2025-09-17-experiment-runner-sdk)**, a high-level SDK abstraction for automatic tracing, concurrent execution, and flexible evaluation.

We also added guides on [systematically interpreting experiment results](/blog/2025-11-06-experiment-interpretation) and [integrating Langfuse into CI/CD pipelines](/blog/2025-10-21-testing-llm-applications) for automated testing.


### Day 5: Score Analytics [#score-analytics]

Scores track application quality, but getting reliable scores at scale is difficult. You must know if your evaluation methods are aligned. Score Analytics helps you compare and validate all your scores, from human ratings to LLM-as-a-judge.

Select a score to see its distribution and trend over time. Add a second score to compare two evaluation methods. Correlation heatmaps and Pearson metrics reveal alignment between evaluators, such as two different LLM judges. This analysis also works for categorical scores to find relationships between trace properties.

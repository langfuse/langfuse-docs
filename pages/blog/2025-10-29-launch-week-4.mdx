It's back! Starting **Monday, November 3rd**, we're dropping a new feature every single day for five days.

### What to Expect?

This launch brings deeper agent insights from your agent applications, improved team collaboration, a big leap in experimentation/evaluation, and more ways to integrate with your favorite tools and frameworks.

We'll unwrap a new feature each day:

<Steps>

#### Day 1: New Filters for Tables and API

  title="New Filters for Tables and API"
  frameBorder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  className="aspect-video rounded border mt-6"
  allowFullScreen
></iframe>

Many users have millions of traces and observations. We've made it easier to filter and search for the data you need.

→ Learn more about [filters in the UI](/changelog/2025-11-03-filter-sidebar-for-tables) and [in the API](/changelog/2025-11-03-advanced-filtering-traces-and-observations-api)

We are excited to announce **Langfuse Launch Week #4**!

Starting on **Monday, November 3&nbsp;–&nbsp;Friday, November 7, 2025**, we'll drop a fresh feature **every single day**. 

Expect to get deeper insights from your agent applications, more guidance on how to get started, improve and evaluate your agent applications, and more ways to integrate with your favorite tools and frameworks.

We'll celebrate with a mid-week [Virtual Community Hour](https://lu.ma/1q57o5ok).

[Star us](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/) on GitHub and follow us on [Twitter](https://x.com/langfuse) so you don't miss an announcement.

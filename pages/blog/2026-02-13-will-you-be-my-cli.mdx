Valentine's Day is here, and while most people are thinking about flowers and chocolates, we've been thinking about something more romantic: **making AI agents fall in love with Langfuse**. 

Over the past months, we've shipped a series of features designed specifically to make Langfuse the perfect companion for AI agents—whether they're coding in your IDE, running in the terminal, or helping you debug your LLM applications. This post walks through our "agent love language": the technical decisions and implementations that make Langfuse easy for agents to discover, understand, and integrate with.

## Why Agents Need Love Too

AI agents are increasingly doing real work: writing code, debugging applications, searching documentation, and even building entire features. But here's the thing—**agents are only as good as the tools they can use**.

When an agent encounters your product, it needs to quickly:

1. **Discover** what you do and what's possible
2. **Understand** how to integrate and use your APIs
3. **Access** documentation in machine-readable formats
4. **Search** efficiently for specific information
5. **Execute** operations through well-defined interfaces
6. **Interact** from their native environment (terminal or IDE)

We realized that if we wanted agents to successfully integrate Langfuse into codebases, we needed to optimize for these needs. So we did. Here's what we built.

### The Six Features We Shipped

1. **llms.txt** - A machine-readable documentation index
2. **Markdown Endpoints** - Docs as raw markdown, not just HTML
3. **OpenAPI-First API** - Comprehensive, machine-readable API documentation
4. **Public Search** - Semantic search available to everyone
5. **Langfuse CLI** - Terminal-based API access auto-generated from OpenAPI
6. **Docs MCP Server** - IDE integration via Model Context Protocol

Let's dive into each one.

---

## 1. llms.txt: The Discovery Layer

**Problem:** How does an agent quickly understand what Langfuse is and what documentation is available?

**Solution:** We implemented [llms.txt](https://langfuse.com/llms.txt), a standard proposed by [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org/) that provides a machine-readable index of your documentation.

### What is llms.txt?

It's a simple markdown file that gives LLMs a high-level overview and links to detailed documentation—all in one place. Here's what ours looks like:

```markdown
# Langfuse

> Langfuse is an **open-source LLM engineering platform** that helps teams 
> collaboratively debug, analyze, and iterate on their LLM applications.

## Langfuse Docs MCP Server

Connect to the Langfuse Docs MCP server to access documentation...

## Docs

- [Observability Overview](/docs/observability/overview.md)
- [Prompt Management](/docs/prompt-management/overview.md)
- [Evaluation](/docs/evaluation/overview.md)
...
```

### Implementation

We auto-generate this file from our sitemap using a [simple Node.js script](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-docs/blob/main/scripts/generate_llms_txt.js) that runs at build time:

```javascript
// scripts/generate_llms_txt.js
async function generateLLMsList() {
  const sitemapContent = fs.readFileSync('public/sitemap-0.xml', 'utf-8');
  const result = await parser.parseStringPromise(sitemapContent);
  
  let markdownContent = `# Langfuse\n\n`;
  markdownContent += `> ${INTRO_DESCRIPTION}\n\n`;
  
  // Group URLs by section (docs, self-hosting, etc.)
  urls.forEach(url => {
    const section = new URL(url).pathname.split('/')[1];
    // ... categorize and format
  });
  
  fs.writeFileSync('public/llms.txt', markdownContent);
}
```

**Why it matters:** When an agent first encounters Langfuse, it can immediately fetch `langfuse.com/llms.txt` and understand the entire documentation structure without crawling hundreds of pages.

---

## 2. Markdown Endpoints: Native Content for Agents

**Problem:** Agents work better with raw markdown than rendered HTML. How do we serve documentation in agent-friendly formats?

**Solution:** Every documentation page can now be accessed as markdown—either by appending `.md` to the URL or by sending an `Accept: text/markdown` header.

### How It Works

We use Next.js rewrites and static file serving to provide markdown versions of all docs. This was a fun technical challenge that required converting our MDX pages to plain markdown at build time and serving them efficiently.

```javascript
// next.config.mjs
async rewrites() {
  return {
    beforeFiles: [
      // Content negotiation via Accept header
      {
        source: "/:path((?!api|_next|md-src)(?!.*\\.md$).*)",
        has: [{ type: "header", key: "accept", value: ".*text/markdown.*" }],
        destination: "/md-src/:path.md",
      },
    ],
    afterFiles: [
      // Manual .md access
      {
        source: "/:path*.md",
        destination: "/md-src/:path*.md",
      },
    ],
  };
}
```

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Fetch markdown by URL extension
curl https://langfuse.com/docs/observability/overview.md

# Or use content negotiation
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" https://langfuse.com/docs/observability/overview
```

**Why it matters:** Agents can now directly consume documentation content without parsing HTML. This powers:
- The "Copy as Markdown" feature in our docs
- The `getLangfuseDocsPage` tool in our MCP server
- Agent-driven integrations in IDEs like Cursor

## 3. OpenAPI-First API Design

**Problem:** How do agents understand what API endpoints are available and how to use them?

**Solution:** We maintain a comprehensive OpenAPI specification that serves as both documentation and a contract for our API.

### API Reference

Our API is fully documented at [api.reference.langfuse.com](https://api.reference.langfuse.com) with:

- Complete endpoint descriptions
- Request/response schemas
- Authentication examples
- Error handling documentation

The OpenAPI spec is available at:

```bash
# Download the full OpenAPI specification
curl https://cloud.langfuse.com/generated/api/openapi.yml
```

### Using the API

Authentication is straightforward with Basic Auth:

```bash
# Fetch traces from your project
curl -u pk-your-public-key:sk-your-secret-key \
  https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/traces

# Create a new score via API
curl -u pk-your-public-key:sk-your-secret-key \
  -X POST https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/scores \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "traceId": "trace-123",
    "name": "quality",
    "value": 0.95
  }'
```

### SDK Access

Both Python and TypeScript SDKs provide strongly-typed wrappers around the API:

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()

# Fetch a trace - fully typed with intellisense
trace = langfuse.api.trace.get("trace-123")

# List all prompts in your project
prompts = langfuse.api.prompts.list()
```

**Why it matters:** Agents can read the OpenAPI spec to understand all available operations, then execute them confidently with proper types and error handling.

---

## 4. Public Search Endpoint

**Problem:** How can agents quickly find relevant information across all documentation?

**Solution:** We exposed our semantic search as a public REST API.

### The Search API

Any agent (or human) can now search Langfuse docs without authentication:

```bash
curl "https://langfuse.com/api/search-docs?query=How%20do%20I%20trace%20LangGraph%20agents"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "query": "How do I trace LangGraph agents",
  "answer": "To trace LangGraph agents with Langfuse, use the native integration...",
  "metadata": {
    "sources": [
      {
        "title": "LangGraph Integration",
        "url": "https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/langgraph"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Implementation

The endpoint uses [Inkeep's RAG API](https://docs.inkeep.com/ai-api/rag-mode/http-request) under the hood:

```typescript
// pages/api/search-docs.ts
export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const query = req.query.query as string;
  
  if (!query) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: "Missing query parameter" });
  }

  const inkeepResult = await searchLangfuseDocsWithInkeep(query);

  return res.status(200).json({
    query,
    answer: inkeepResult.answer,
    metadata: inkeepResult.metadata,
  });
}
```

**Why it matters:** Instead of reading through dozens of documentation pages, agents can ask natural language questions and get synthesized answers with source citations.

---

## 5. Langfuse CLI: Direct API Access from the Terminal

**Problem:** Agents often work in terminal environments. How can they interact with Langfuse without writing HTTP requests manually?

**Solution:** We built `langfuse-cli` — a command-line interface that wraps the entire Langfuse API, auto-generated from our OpenAPI spec.

### What is langfuse-cli?

It's a CLI tool built on [specli](https://github.com/vercel-labs/specli) that generates commands directly from the OpenAPI specification. Every API endpoint becomes a CLI command with proper flags, validation, and help text.

### Installation & Usage

```bash
# Run directly with npx
npx langfuse-cli traces list --limit 10

# Or install globally
npm install -g langfuse-cli
langfuse prompts get --name my-prompt

# Configure with environment variables
export LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-...
export LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...
export LANGFUSE_HOST=https://cloud.langfuse.com

# List all available resources
langfuse __schema

# Get help for any resource
langfuse traces --help

# JSON output for scripting
langfuse traces list --limit 5 --json

# Preview the curl command
langfuse scores list --curl
```

### Examples

```bash
# Fetch recent traces
langfuse traces list --limit 10

# Get a specific trace by ID
langfuse traces get <trace-id>

# List all prompts
langfuse prompts list

# Get a prompt by name
langfuse prompts get --name "customer-support-v1"

# List dataset items
langfuse dataset-items list --dataset-name "qa-examples"

# Create a score
langfuse scores create \
  --trace-id abc123 \
  --name quality \
  --value 0.95
```

### For Agents: The Skill File

Here's what makes this especially agent-friendly — we include a **skill file** at `skill/langfuse-cli.md` that teaches AI agents how to use the CLI:

```markdown
# Langfuse CLI Skill

The Langfuse CLI provides command-line access to the Langfuse API.

## Installation
npx langfuse-cli <resource> <action>

## Common Operations

### Traces
- List traces: langfuse traces list --limit 10
- Get trace: langfuse traces get <id>
- Search: langfuse traces list --user-id <user> --json

### Prompts  
- List: langfuse prompts list
- Get: langfuse prompts get --name <name>

... [full skill documentation]
```

Agents can read this file to understand all available commands, flags, and usage patterns.

### Why Auto-Generate from OpenAPI?

By generating the CLI from the OpenAPI spec, we get:

1. **Always in sync** - CLI updates automatically when the API changes
2. **Complete coverage** - Every endpoint becomes a command
3. **Proper validation** - Request schemas enforce correct input
4. **Built-in help** - Auto-generated help text for every command
5. **Type safety** - Flags match the API parameter types exactly

### Technical Implementation

The CLI is built using a patched OpenAPI spec. We flatten discriminated unions (`oneOf` with `allOf`) into plain objects so specli can generate proper command flags:

```typescript
// scripts/patch-openapi.ts
// Flattens complex union types for CLI generation
export function patchOpenAPI(spec: OpenAPISpec) {
  // Convert oneOf/allOf patterns to flat object schemas
  // This makes endpoints like `prompts create` generate proper flags
  return flattenedSpec;
}
```

**Why it matters:** Agents working in terminal environments can now interact with Langfuse using natural command-line syntax. They can list traces, fetch prompts, create scores, and manage datasets—all without writing API client code. The skill file provides the knowledge, and the CLI provides the interface.

## 6. Docs MCP Server: The IDE Integration Layer

**Problem:** How do we make all these capabilities easily accessible to AI coding assistants in their native environment?

**Solution:** We built an [MCP (Model Context Protocol) server](https://langfuse.com/docs/docs-mcp) that exposes Langfuse docs through standardized tools.

### What is MCP?

MCP is a protocol that enables AI assistants to interact with external tools and data sources. Our MCP server provides three tools:

1. **`searchLangfuseDocs`** - Semantic search (uses the public search endpoint)
2. **`getLangfuseDocsPage`** - Fetch specific pages as markdown
3. **`getLangfuseOverview`** - Get the high-level index (fetches llms.txt)

### Installation

The MCP server works in Cursor, VS Code, Claude Desktop, and any MCP-compatible client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "langfuse-docs": {
      "url": "https://langfuse.com/api/mcp",
      "transport": "streamableHttp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Example Usage in Cursor

Once installed, agents in Cursor can automatically:

```
User: "Add Langfuse tracing to my LangGraph application"

Agent: Let me search the Langfuse docs...
[Calls searchLangfuseDocs with query: "LangGraph integration"]

Agent: I found the integration guide. Let me get the full details...
[Calls getLangfuseDocsPage with path: "/docs/integrations/langgraph"]

Agent: Based on the documentation, here's how to add tracing:

[Agent writes the integration code with proper imports and configuration]
```

### Implementation

The MCP server is implemented as a Next.js API route:

```typescript
// pages/api/mcp.ts
export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const mcpServer = new Server({
    name: "langfuse-docs",
    version: "1.0.0",
  });

  mcpServer.tool("searchLangfuseDocs", async ({ query }) => {
    const result = await searchLangfuseDocsWithInkeep(query);
    return result.answer;
  });

  mcpServer.tool("getLangfuseDocsPage", async ({ path }) => {
    const markdown = await fetchMarkdownPage(path);
    return markdown;
  });

  mcpServer.tool("getLangfuseOverview", async () => {
    return await fetch("https://langfuse.com/llms.txt").then(r => r.text());
  });

  // Handle MCP protocol
  await handleMcpRequest(req, res, mcpServer);
}
```

**Why it matters:** This is the capstone that ties everything together. Agents can now discover Langfuse (via llms.txt), search for relevant information (via search API), fetch detailed documentation (via markdown endpoints), and execute operations (via the REST API)—all through a standardized interface.

## The Love Story Continues

Here's what an agent's journey looks like when integrating Langfuse—from discovery to implementation:

<Steps>

### Discovery

Agent encounters a mention of Langfuse and wants to learn more.

```bash
# Fetches the overview
curl https://langfuse.com/llms.txt
```

### Search

Agent needs to find specific integration documentation.

```bash
# Searches for relevant content
curl "https://langfuse.com/api/search-docs?query=LangChain%20integration"
```

### Deep Dive

Agent wants to read the full integration guide.

```bash
# Gets the raw markdown documentation
curl https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/langchain.md
```

### Implementation

Agent writes the integration code using the SDK or CLI.

```python
# Option 1: Using the Python SDK
from langfuse import get_client
from langchain.callbacks import LangfuseCallbackHandler

langfuse = get_client()
callback = LangfuseCallbackHandler()

# ... rest of implementation
```

```bash
# Option 2: Using the CLI for quick testing
langfuse traces list --limit 5 --json | jq '.data[] | {id, name}'
```

### Verification

Agent can now debug and monitor the integration through the Langfuse UI or CLI.

</Steps>

## Key Takeaways

If you're building developer tools that you want agents to adopt:

### 1. Provide a Discovery Mechanism

Implement `llms.txt` or similar. It's simple to generate and hugely valuable for agents trying to understand your product.

### 2. Make Content Machine-Readable

Serve documentation in formats agents can parse—markdown, JSON, etc. Don't force them to extract content from HTML.

### 3. Expose Public Search

Let agents ask questions about your docs. Semantic search is powerful and the infrastructure is increasingly commoditized.

### 4. Maintain Strong API Documentation

Keep your OpenAPI spec updated and comprehensive. It's the contract that agents rely on.

### 5. Build a CLI

Provide command-line access to your API. Agents often work in terminal environments and benefit from command-line interfaces.

### 6. Support Standardized Protocols

Give agents a standardized way to access your capabilities. MCP is gaining adoption and integrating with popular IDEs.

For teams building their LLM app with Langchain, adopting Langfuse just got easier. We added a `CallbackHandler` to the Langfuse Python SDK that natively integrates with [Langchain Callbacks](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/callbacks/).

## ðŸª¢ + ðŸ¦œðŸ”— â†’ ðŸ¤Œ

```python /callbacks=[handler]/
# Initialize Langfuse handler
from langfuse.callback import CallbackHandler
handler = CallbackHandler(PUBLIC_KEY, SECRET_KEY)

# Setup Langchain
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
...
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

# Add Langfuse handler as callback
chain.run(input="<user_input", callbacks=[handler])
```

_From the [Langchain integration docs](/docs/langchain)_

## Which actions are tracked?

The Langfuse `CallbackHandler` tracks the following actions when using Langchain:

- Chains: `on_chain_start`, `on_chain_end`. `on_chain_error`
- Agents: `on_agent_start`, `on_agent_action`, `on_agent_finish`, `on_agent_end`
- Tools: `on_tool_start`, `on_tool_end`, `on_tool_error`
- Retriever: `on_retriever_start`, `on_retriever_end`
- ChatModel: `on_chat_model_start`,
- LLM: `on_llm_start`, `on_llm_end`, `on_llm_error`

All actions are automatically nested based on the call tree and include inputs, outputs, model configurations, token counts, latencies and errors.

## How does it look like in Langfuse?

## About Langfuse

Langfuse is an open source product analytics platform for LLM applications. It is used by teams to track and analyze their LLM app in production with regards to quality, cost and latency across product releases and use cases. In addition, the Langfuse Debug UI helps to visualize the control flow of LLM apps in production. Read our [launch post](/blog/product-analytics-for-LLM-apps) if you want to learn more.

## Next steps

- Read the [Langchain integration](/docs/langchain) docs for more details and examples to get started.
- **Not (exclusively) using Langchain in production?** Follow the [quickstart](/docs/get-started) to get started with the Typescript and Python SDKs that allow you to integrate with your custom LLM app.

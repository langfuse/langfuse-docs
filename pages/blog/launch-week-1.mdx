## Launches

### Day 0: OpenAI JS SDK Integration

```typescript /import { observeOpenAI } from "langfuse"/ /observeOpenAI/
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { observeOpenAI } from "langfuse";

// wrap the OpenAI SDK
const openai = observeOpenAI(new OpenAI());

// use the OpenAI SDK as you normally would
const res = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [{ role: "system", content: "Tell me a story." }],
});
```

We [launched](/changelog/2024-04-21-openai-integration-JS-SDK) a new wrapper for the OpenAI JS SDK. This integration, designed to enable easier monitoring of OpenAI API usage, features seamless observability with enhancements like automatic tracking of prompts, completions, and API errors, as well as insights into model usage and costs. After a soft launch that gathered user feedback for improvements, the integration is now fully available, complete with comprehensive [documentation](/docs/integrations/openai/js/get-started) and an [example notebook](/docs/integrations/openai/js/examples).

### Day 1: PostHog Integration

We teamed up with [PostHog](https://posthog.com) (OSS product analytics) to integrate LLM-related product metrics into your existing PostHog dashboards. This integration is [now available](/changelog/2024-04-22-posthog-integration) in public beta on Langfuse cloud. You can configure it within your Langfuse project settings. When activated, Langfuse sends metrics related to traces, generations, and scores to PostHog. You can then build custom dashboards to visualize the data or use the _LLM Analytics_ dashboard template to get started quickly. See [docs](/docs/analytics/posthog) for more information.

### Day 2: LLM Playground

We're excited to introduce the [**LLM Playground**](/docs/playground) to Langfuse. By making prompt engineering possible directly in Langfuse, we take another step in our mission to build a feature-complete LLM engineering platform that helps you along the full live cycle of your LLM application. With the LLM playground, you can now test and iterate your prompts directly in Langfuse. Either start from scratch or jump into the playground from an existing prompt in your project. See the [docs](/docs/playground) for more details and let us know what you think in the [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1170).

## Launch Week Events

### Wednesday: First virtual town hall [#townhall]

You're invited to our first virtual town hall. We (Max, Marc and Clemens) will be demoing new features in Langfuse, answering questions and talking about where we're taking the project. We're looking forward to hanging out!

- Where: Google Meet

### Friday: Langfuse 2.0 on Product Hunt

We will end the week with the launch of **Langfuse 2.0** on Product Hunt on Friday, April 26th. After our [initial launch](/ph) last year – which led to a [Golden Kitty Award](https://www.producthunt.com/golden-kitty-awards/hall-of-fame?year=2023#ai-infra) – we are very excited to be back on Product Hunt.

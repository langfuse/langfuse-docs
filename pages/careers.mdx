# Join Us!

Langfuse is building the leading **open-source LLM engineering platform** (**[Why Langfuse?](/why)**).

**We are hiring across the board for technical and technical go-to-market roles. We work in-person in Berlin, Germany & are building an excellent, small team.** If you are considering new opportunities -- even if you might not be looking immediately, we would love to hear from you & get coffee.

While LLMs improve a lot, we don’t see enough applications in production. Building these applications requires a new workflow of continuous monitoring and evaluation that we enable with Langfuse [[1]](#footnotes).
We are seeing strong traction over recent months (see metrics below), thus it is the right time to grow the team to build out our backend systems, product, and how we communicate with developers.

We have raised a [$4M seed round](/blog/announcing-our-seed-round) from Lightspeed, General Catalyst, Y Combinator and angels.

## Why Join Langfuse?

**Impactful work/product for awesome OSS community and users**. We get to work with extremely smart users in our OSS community who share a ton of great feedback, and it feels great to help them build exciting products. You’ll also get to work with many large enterprises and YC companies who monitor and improve their LLM products with Langfuse.

**Strong in-person engineering culture**. Including Hassieb and Marlies who joined recently, ⅘ people on the team work on our product; our go-to-market (also Enterprise) is almost exclusively bottom-up, and we enjoy building a developer tool together with our open-source community [[4]](#footnotes).

**Interesting challenges**. Building an open source developer tool with a strong observability component is engineering-wise highly interesting due the various integrations and SDKs, the chance to design the best LLM Engineering workflows for these teams, and the necessity to scale our backend-logic and infrastructure [[5]](#footnotes).

**Growth & Ownership**. We believe that a product like ours is best built by a small group of excellent engineers who fully own the components that they build. This includes running them in production, product feedback and roadmap planning, and design. We are a small team that’s moving fast [[6]](#footnotes) with a focus on great developer experience.

**Shared curiosity and interest**. If you are interested in working with engineering teams who rethink what’s possible when using LLMs to power new use cases, come work with us as we all share this excitement and get to see the leading edge of what great teams build every day. Next to shipping quickly this is the most fun part for sure.

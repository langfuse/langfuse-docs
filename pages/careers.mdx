While LLMs improve a lot, we don't see enough applications in production. Building these applications requires a new workflow of continuous monitoring and evaluation that we enable with Langfuse.
We are seeing strong traction (see metrics below), thus it is the right time to grow the team to build out our backend systems, product, and how we communicate with developers.

We have raised a [$4M seed round](/blog/announcing-our-seed-round) from Lightspeed, General Catalyst, Y Combinator and angels. We are growing fast (see metrics below) and work with some of the best AI teams such as Samsara, Twilio, KhanAcademy and Rocket Money.

If complex technical problems & great developer experiences excite you, we'd love to hear from you.

  items={[

      area: "A-Team",
      impact: "We want to build a small group of high leverage individuals. Everyone on our team earns their spot. We strive to raise the bar with every addition. Many on the team have led companies/teams before but are excited about shipping as an IC.",

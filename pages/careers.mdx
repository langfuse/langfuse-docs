# Join Us!

Langfuse is building the leading **open-source LLM engineering platform**.

While LLMs improved a lot, we don’t see enough applications in production. Building these applications requires a new workflow of continuous monitoring and evaluation that we enable with Langfuse [[1]](#footnotes).

We are seeing strong traction over recent months (see metrics below), thus it is the right time to grow the team to build out our backend systems, product, and how we communicate with developers.

We have raised a [$4M seed round](/blog/announcing-our-seed-round) from Lightspeed, La Famiglia, Y Combinator and angels.

**A few tidbits that might help you understand what kind of company we are:**

- We plan on only hiring engineers for the foreseeable future
- You can expect to have ~1 meeting a day on average
- Reed Hastings’ ‘No Rules Rules’ inspires our culture, [here’s a summary](https://www.mattswain.com/booknotes/no-rules-rules)
- We were heavily influenced by our time at Y Combinator and follow its ethos. We’re a Silicon Valley Startup in Berlin - [more here](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4D-yc-s-essential-startup-advice)

PS: We are based in Berlin (Germany) and work [in person](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rawert_why-we-decided-to-build-langfuse-in-person-activity-7150905769528385536-yuqi). Come join us build one of the most exciting open source devtool companies in Europe!

## Roles

<Callout type="info">
  Can't find a role that's a perfect fit? If you are excited about delivering
  exceptional developer experiences and building a high-quality open-source
  product alongside an insanely motivated team that [ships](/changelog), feel
  free to reach out: careers@langfuse.com
</Callout>

- [Backend Engineer](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/langfuse/jobs/mnrdwla-backend-engineer)
  - _Berlin, €70K - €130K EUR, 0.25% - 0.75%_
  - Ensure that the Langfuse platform scales. At the core of Langfuse lies the async ingestion of millions of events a day via our SDKs while being able to visualize them in near-real time in our debugging and dashboard UI. Current projects include migrating to Clickhouse for fast analytical reads, and building out the infrastructure (APIs, DevOps) to ingest, store and analyze large multi-modal traces (images, audio, video).
- [Product Engineer](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/langfuse/jobs/aAvmoFB-product-engineer)
  - _Berlin, €70K - €130K EUR, 0.25% - 0.75%_
  - Design, scope, ship, and launch new full-stack (UI, backend, SDKs, integrations) features on top of our existing data platform. See launch week post [[2]](#footnotes) for a good selection of things you could have worked on.
- [Developer Advocate / Devrel](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/langfuse/jobs/uHysbKH-developer-advocate-devrel)
  - _Berlin, €60K - €110K EUR, 0.25% - 0.50%_
  - Run our bottom-up go-to-market via developer-focused content, documentation, partnerships, events, community-building, and whatever else works. Langfuse is a platform of many building blocks and there are lots of common workflows we can educate on to drive awareness and adoption [[3]](#footnotes).

Please apply via Work At a Startup or send us an email with your CV/LinkedIn to careers@langfuse.com

You need to be located in Berlin, Germany or willing to relocate. Your superday interview will be held onsite in Berlin. The first few interviews will be conducted via Zoom.

## Why Join Langfuse?

**Impactful work/product for awesome OSS community and users**. We get to work with extremely smart users in our OSS community who share a ton of great feedback, and it feels great to help them build exciting products. You’ll also get to work with many large enterprises and YC companies who monitor and improve their LLM products with Langfuse.

**Strong in-person engineering culture**. Including Hassieb and Marlies who joined recently, ⅘ people on the team work on our product; our go-to-market (also Enterprise) is almost exclusively bottom-up, and we enjoy building a developer tool together with our open-source community [[4]](#footnotes).

**Interesting challenges**. Building an open source developer tool with a strong observability component is engineering-wise highly interesting due the various integrations and SDKs, the chance to design the best LLM Engineering workflows for these teams, and the necessity to scale our backend-logic and infrastructure [[5]](#footnotes).

**Growth & Ownership**. We believe that a product like ours is best built by a small group of excellent engineers who fully own the components that they build. This includes running them in production, product feedback and roadmap planning, and design. We are a small team that’s moving fast [[6]](#footnotes) with a focus on great developer experience.

**Shared curiosity and interest**. If you are interested in working with engineering teams who rethink what’s possible when using LLMs to power new use cases, come work with us as we all share this excitement and get to see the leading edge of what great teams build every day. Next to shipping quickly this is the most fun part for sure.

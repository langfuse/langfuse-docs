Select high-quality (e.g. good eval/feedback) generations and fine-tune your models based on production data.

<Callout type="info" emoji="⚠️">
  We discontinued support for OpenAI-JSONL because standardizing the data for
  direct fine-tuning became too complex after transitioning to the new
  asynchronous batch exports.

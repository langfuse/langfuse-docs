title: Python SDK now supports Pydantic v1 and v2
description: The Python SDK uses Pydantic to validate the data you send to Langfuse at run time before it is asynchronously sent to the Langfuse API. Previously, the Python SDK used Pydantic v1 leading to incompatibilities with projects using Pydantic v2.

**Minor improvement to the integration:** environment variables can also be set as attributes on the `openai` object.

```python
# existing method
import os
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
from langfuse.openai import openai

# additional method
from langfuse.openai import openai
openai.langfuse_public_key = "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"
openai.langfuse_secret_key = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
```

See the [OpenAI SDK integration](/docs/openai) page for more information.

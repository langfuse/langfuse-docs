import { ChangelogHeader } from "@/components/changelog/ChangelogHeader";

<ChangelogHeader />

Example use cases:

- Conversations / threads
- Multiple interactions within a user session

To get started, add a `sessionId` string when creating/updating a trace. See [docs](/docs/sessions) for full details on how to add sessions to your traces.

Tagging allows you to flexibly add metadata to your traces, making it easier to categorize, filter, and manage them.
Tags are a simple yet effective way to organize your traces. They can be added directly to the trace object from the SDK and can be used to filter and group traces in Langfuse. 

### 🎯 How it works
You add tags to your traces using the Langfuse SDK or directly from the UI. You can filter and group your traces based on these tags (soon also from the GET API).

```python
trace.tags = ["my-first-tag", "even-better-tag"]
```

### 🕹️ Try it out
Head over to the [docs](/docs/tracing#tagging-traces) to learn more and get started. You can also see traces in action by [logging into](https://cloud.langfuse.com) your account and selecting the ‘langfuse-docs‘ project. Don't hesitate to reach out to us with feedback.

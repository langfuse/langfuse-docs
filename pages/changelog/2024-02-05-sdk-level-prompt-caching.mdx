<ChangelogHeader />

After launching the highly anticipated [prompt management](/docs/prompt-management/overview) feature in Langfuse, we've enhanced its performance and reliability in the Python and JS/TS SDKs through prompt caching. This feature stores prompts in the client SDKs' memory, cutting down on server requests and boosting your applications' reliability and speed. With a default TTL of 60 seconds, caching settings can be adjusted for individual prompts within the SDK. Should a refetch of a prompt fail, the SDK will automatically revert to the cached version, ensuring your application's availability is not compromised.

### How it works

```python
# Get current production prompt version and cache for 5 minutes
prompt = langfuse.get_prompt("prompt name", cache_ttl_seconds=300)

# Get a specific prompt version and cache for 5 minutes
prompt = langfuse.get_prompt("prompt name", version=3, cache_ttl_seconds=300)

# Disable caching for a prompt
prompt = langfuse.get_prompt("prompt name", cache_ttl_seconds=0)
```

</Tab>

<Tab>

```ts
// Get current production version and cache prompt for 5 minutes
const prompt = await langfuse.getPrompt("prompt name", undefined, {
  cacheTtlSeconds: 300,
});

// Get prompt version 3 and cache for 5 minutes
const prompt = await langfuse.getPrompt("prompt name", 3, {
  cacheTtlSeconds: 300,
});

// Disable caching for a prompt
const prompt = await langfuse.getPrompt("prompt name", undefined, {
  cacheTtlSeconds: 0,
});
```

### Upgrade path

To benefit from prompt caching, upgrade to the latest version of the Python and JS/TS SDKs. The caching feature is enabled with a 60 seconds TTL default, so you don't need to make any changes to your code to start using it.

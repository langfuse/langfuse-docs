## Overview

Returned data includes:

- Daily trace count
- Daily total cost
- Daily usage per model (broken down by input and output)

Optional filters

- `traceName` to commonly filter by the application type, depending on how you use `name` in your traces
- `userId` to filter by [user](/docs/tracing-features/users)
- `tags` to filter by [tags](/docs/tracing-features/tags)

See [API reference](https://api.reference.langfuse.com/#get-/api/public/metrics/daily) for more details.

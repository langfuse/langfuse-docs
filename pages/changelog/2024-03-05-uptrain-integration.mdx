## How-to

<Steps>

### Trace your application with Langfuse

Use any Langfuse [integration](/docs/integrations).

### Pull (a sample) via our Python SDK

Define which traces/LLM-calls you want to evaluate and pull them via our Python SDK.

### Run Uptrain OSS evals

You can find the complete list of UpTrain evals [here](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain?tab=readme-ov-file#pre-built-evaluations-we-offer-).

### Log scores to Langfuse

Use Langfuse [Scores](/docs/scores) to track the eval results in Langfuse.

</Steps>

We have set up an end-to-end cookbook which makes evaluating your traces with UpTrain happen in a jiffy:

import { FileCode } from "lucide-react";

<Cards num={3}>
  <Card
    title="Uptrain + Langfuse Coookbook"
    href="/guides/cookbook/evaluation_with_uptrain"
    icon={<FileCode />}
  />
</Cards>

## Sneak peak

We are currently working on an evaluation service to automatically score all incoming observations by running custom evaluation templates. Ping us if you want to be among the first to try it: early-access@langfuse.com

## Use >20 evaluators through Langfuse &lt;-> Uptrain integration

You can easily evaluate existing traces in Langfuse by loading them into a notebook, running UpTrain evaluators on them and writing the scores back to your data in Langfuse. You can find the complete list of UpTrain evals [here](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain?tab=readme-ov-file#pre-built-evaluations-we-offer-).

**Get Started:** We have set up [a cookbook](https://langfuse.com/cookbook/evaluation_with_uptrain) which makes evaluating your first traces happen in a jiffy.

**Sneak peak**: We are currently working on an evaluation service to automatically score all incoming observations by running custom evaluation templates. Ping us if you want to be among the first to try it: early-access@langfuse.com

On Day 3 of [Launch Week 1](/blog/launch-week-1), we're happy to share that the Decorator-based integration for Python now supports all Langfuse features and is the recommended way to use Langfuse in Python.

The decorator makes integrating with Langfuse so much easier. Head over to the [Python Decorator docs](/docs/sdk/python/decorators) to learn more. All inputs, outputs, timings are captured automatically, and it works with all other [Langfuse integrations](/integrations) (LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI SDK, ...).

To celebrate this milestone, we wrote a [blog post](/blog/2024-04-python-decorator) on the technical details and created the [example notebook](/guides/cookbook/example_decorator_openai_langchain) shown in the video as it demonstrates what's really cool about the decorator. Let us know what you think in the [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1009), and stay tuned for more updates during [Langfuse Launch Week 1](/blog/launch-week-1) 🚀

Thanks again to [@lshalon](https://github.com/lshalon) and [@AshisGhosh](https://github.com/AshisGhosh) for your contributions to this!

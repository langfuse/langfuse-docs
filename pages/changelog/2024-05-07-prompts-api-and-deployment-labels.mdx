## REST API for prompt management

We revamped the API for prompt management to allow you to fully manage prompts via the REST API. You can now fetch, create, and update prompts programmatically.

New endpoints ([API reference](https://api.reference.langfuse.com)):

- `GET /api/public/v2/prompts`
- `GET /api/public/v2/prompts/{promptName}`
- `POST /api/public/v2/prompts`

## Deployment labels for prompts

</Frame>

You can now add labels to prompts to deploy different versions to different environments. Thereby, you can manage the lifecycle of prompts across different environments, such as development, staging, and production. The latest version is always available under the `latest` label for local development and testing.

See [prompt management docs](/docs/prompts) for more details.

[Langfuse Prompt Management](/docs/prompts) just got even more exciting. We've added a new feature enabling you to compare scores and metrics across different prompt versions. Key metrics now include trace-level and generation-level scores. This feature helps in understanding how prompt modifications influence model performance. Additionally, you can view the generations linked to each prompt version, providing insight into how changes affect generation quality.

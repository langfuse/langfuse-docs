## How to Enable Dark Mode

To enable dark mode, simply toggle the new switch located in the user menu. The UI will instantly adapt to the new color scheme, providing a seamless transition.

## Automatic System Sync

For added convenience, the Langfuse dark mode will automatically sync with your system's appearance settings. If you prefer to have your applications follow a consistent theme, the UI will adjust accordingly.

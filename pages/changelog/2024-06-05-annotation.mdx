Introducing our revamped annotation workflow via the Langfuse UI allowing you to effectively collaborate with your team on human-in-the-loop evaluations. 

## Highlights
- **Centralized score configuration management**: Standardize score names, data types and criteria project-wide.

- **Improved data type support**: Annotate numeric, categorical, and binary scores.
- **Comment feature**: Optionally add context to each score for improved data interpretation.

<ChangelogHeader />

Since the very beginning, all Langfuse Tracing data has been open and accessible via the Langfuse API. Today, we're excited to finally release the SDK methods to conveniently query traces, observations, and sessions directly from the Langfuse API.

```bash
pip install langfuse
```

```python
from langfuse import Langfuse
langfuse = Langfuse()

# Fetch list of traces, supports filters and pagination
traces = langfuse.fetch_traces()

# Fetch a single trace by ID
trace = langfuse.fetch_trace("traceId")

# Fetch list of observations, supports filters and pagination
observations = langfuse.fetch_observations()

# Fetch a single observation by ID
observation = langfuse.fetch_observation("observationId")

# Fetch list of sessions
sessions = langfuse.fetch_sessions()
```

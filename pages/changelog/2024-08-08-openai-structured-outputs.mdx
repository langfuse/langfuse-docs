## What are structured outputs?

Generating structured data from unstructured inputs is a core AI use case today. Developers use the OpenAI API to build applications that fetch data, answer questions via function calling, extract structured data, and create multi-step workflows for LLMs to take actions. [Structured Outputs](https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/) is a new capability of the OpenAI API that builds upon JSON mode and function calling to enforce a strict schema in a model output.

## How to trace structured output in Langfuse?

If you use the [OpenAI Python SDK](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/openai/python/get-started), you can use the Langfuse **drop-in OpenAI SDK replacement** to get full logging by changing only the import. With that, you can monitor the structured output generated by OpenAI in Langfuse.

```diff
- import openai
+ from langfuse.openai import openai

Alternative imports:
+ from langfuse.openai import OpenAI, AsyncOpenAI, AzureOpenAI, AsyncAzureOpenAI
```

For and end-to-end example, have a look at our cookbook on tracing stuctured outputs with Langfuse:

import { FileCode, BookOpen } from "lucide-react";

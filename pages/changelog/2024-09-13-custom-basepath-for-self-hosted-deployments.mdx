You can now deploy Langfuse behind a custom base path (e.g. `https://yourdomain.com/langfuse`) by setting the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` environment variable. This allows for more flexible self-hosting configurations, especially when integrating Langfuse into existing infrastructure.

To use a custom base path:

1. Set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` environment variable at build time.
2. Build the Docker image. As this base path is inlined in static assets, you cannot use the prebuilt docker images.

See the [self-hosting documentation](/self-hosting/custom-base-path) for more details. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/2400) on this!

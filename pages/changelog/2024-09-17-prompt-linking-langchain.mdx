<ChangelogHeader />

We have just released one of the [most requested](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/2237) features for Langfuse prompt management: linking Langfuse prompts to Langchain executions to benefit from detailed insight on prompt usage.

With the link established between a prompt managed in Langfuse and its corresponding Langchain executions, the performance of each given prompt can be tracked on the Langfuse platform.

In the trace view on the Langfuse platform you will notice your prompt link appearing alongside your Langchain generation. You may also filter your generations for a given prompt in the generations table and list all generations that originated from a prompt in the prompt detail view.

<ChangelogHeader />

We're excited to announce a new [integration example for DSPy](/docs/integrations/dspy), a framework that systematically optimizes language model prompts and weights. This integration allows Langfuse users to leverage DSPy's powerful capabilities while benefiting from Langfuse's observability features.

Key highlights of the DSPy integration example:

- Automated tracing for OpenAI models within DSPy
- Custom tracker implementation for non-OpenAI models (e.g., Mistral)
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) example showcasing DSPy's optimization capabilities

Thanks to [@xucailiang](https://github.com/xucailiang) for the [contribution](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/pull/1186) to DSPy!

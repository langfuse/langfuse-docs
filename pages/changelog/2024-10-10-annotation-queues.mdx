We're excited to announce the launch of Langfuse Annotation Queues, a powerful new feature designed to streamline your human annotation workflows. This addition provides a toolset for managing and organizing annotation tasks, simplifying the process of generating baseline evaluation datasets for your LLM applications. Annotation Queues enhance consistency, reduce management time, increase throughput, provide an intuitive user experience, and enable efficient scaling of annotation efforts.

## Key Features

- **Queue Management**: Easily create, edit, and delete annotation queues to organize your annotation tasks efficiently.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor the status of annotation tasks.
- **Define Score Dimensions**: Define score dimensions (see [score configs](/docs/scores/annotation)) by queue to ensure consistent evaluation.

We've added color-coding to the latency and costs in the trace view to make it easier to detect outliers and debug the LLM application.

- Red: When the ratio is 75% or higher.
- Yellow: When the ratio is between 50% and 75%.
- No color: When the ratio is below 50%.

The color-coding can be switched off via the percentage button in the top right corner of the trace view.

The ratio indicates the position of a value within a defined range, expressed as a decimal between 0 and 1. A ratio of 0 means the value is at the minimum, while a ratio of 1 means the value is at the maximum. Ratios between 0 and 1 show the relative position of the value within this range.

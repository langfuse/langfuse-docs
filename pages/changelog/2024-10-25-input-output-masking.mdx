SDK-side masking enables you to:

1. Redact sensitive information from trace or observation inputs and outputs.
2. Customize the content of events before transmission.
3. Implement fine-grained data filtering based on your specific requirements.

The process works as follows:

1. You define a custom masking function and pass it to the Langfuse client constructor.
2. All event inputs and outputs are processed through this function.
3. The masked eventdata is then sent to the Langfuse server.

This approach ensures that you have complete control over the event input and output data traced by your application.

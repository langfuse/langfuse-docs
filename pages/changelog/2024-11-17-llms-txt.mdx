Next to the major [Launch Week 2](/blog/2024-11-17-launch-week-2) announcements, we've added a new `llms.txt` file to the Langfuse docs. This file allows you to easily use Langfuse docs in Cursor and other LLM editors.

[`https://langfuse.com/llms.txt`](https://langfuse.com/llms.txt)

## About `llms.txt`

The `llms.txt` file format was proposed by [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org/) as a standard way to provide information to help LLMs use a website at inference time.

> We propose that those interested in providing LLM-friendly content add a /llms.txt file to their site. This is a markdown file that provides brief background information and guidance, along with links to markdown files (which can also link to external sites) providing more detailed information.

## How did we implement this?

The `llms.txt` file is generated using the [generate_llms_txt.js](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-docs/blob/main/scripts/generate_llms_txt.js) script. This script parses the sitemap, extracts the relevant pages, auto-generates titles, and outputs the `llms.txt` file. The script is automatically run when the docs are built ([package.json](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-docs/blob/main/package.json)).

See [PR #984](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-docs/pull/984) for more details.

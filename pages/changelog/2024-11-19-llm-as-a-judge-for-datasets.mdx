## Introduction

Building reliable AI applications is challenging because it's hard to understand how changes impact performance. Without proper evaluation, teams end up playing whack-a-mole with bugs and regressions. Langfuse's new offline LLM-as-a-judge evaluators help transform this uncertainty into a structured engineering process.

## What's new?

Day 2 of [Launch Week 2](/blog/2024-11-17-launch-week-2) brings comprehensive offline evaluation capabilities to Langfuse. This feature helps you:
- Measure the impact of changes before deployment
- Identify regressions early
- Compare specific dataset items across different runs using reliable scores 
- Build stronger conviction in your test datasets by identifying gaps between test and production evaluations
- Create reliable feedback loops for development

## How it works

<Steps>

### 1. Set up your LLM-as-a-judge evaluator

Evaluators in Langfuse consist of three key components:
- **Dataset**: Select which test examples (production cases, synthetic data, or manual tests) your evaluator should run on 
- **Prompt**: The prompt you want to use for evaluation including mapping variables from your dataset items to prompt variables
- **Scoring**: A custom score name and comment format you'd like the LLM evaluator to produce 
- **Metadata**: Sampling rates to control costs, and delay to steer delay after running your experiment 

### 2. Run evaluations



### 3. Analyze results

Use the Langfuse UI to:
1. Compare metrics across experiment runs
2. Drill down into specific examples
3. Identify patterns in successes/failures
4. Track performance over time
5. Identify when to add more test cases to your dataset, as evaluation on test dataset is strong but production evaluation is weak

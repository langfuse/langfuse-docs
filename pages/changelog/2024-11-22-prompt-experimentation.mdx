badge: Launch Week 2 🚀
description: Move fast on prompts without breaking things! Run experiments on Datasets and directly compare evaluation results side-by-side. Experimentation speeds up the feedback loop when working on prompts and prevents regressions when making rapid changes.

On Day 5 of [Langfuse Launch Week 2](/blog/2024-11-17-launch-week-2), we're excited to announce **Prompt Experimentation**. They are the final piece of the launch week theme of _"closing the development loop"_ and allow you to:

1. Test a prompt version from Langfuse [Prompt Management](/docs/prompt-management/overview)
2. on a [Dataset](/docs/datasets) of test inputs and expected outputs
3. optionally, use [LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluators](/docs/scores/model-based-evals) to automatically evaluate the responses based on the expected outputs ([released](/changelog/2024-11-19-llm-as-a-judge-for-datasets) this launch week)
4. and finally, compare the results in the new side-by-side experiment comparison view ([released](/changelog/2024-11-18-dataset-runs-comparison-view) this launch week)

Check out the [docs](/docs/datasets/prompt-experiments) to learn more.

LLMs have grown more powerful by supporting multi-modal generations, reasoning, and caching. As LLM usage pricing departs from a simple input/output token count, we are excited that Langfuse now supports cost tracking for arbitrary usage types. Generation cost are now accurately calculated and displayed in the UI.

In the Langfuse UI, you can now create LLM model definitions with prices for arbitrary usage types. When ingesting generations, you can provide the units consumed for each usage type. Langfuse will then calculate the cost for each generation.

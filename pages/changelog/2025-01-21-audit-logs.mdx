Audit logs provide comprehensive tracking of all system activities, capturing detailed information about who performed what actions, when they occurred, and what changes were made. This feature is essential for enterprise security, compliance requirements, and incident investigation.

Key features include:

- **Complete Activity Tracking**: Monitor user and API actions across your organization
- **State Capture**: Full before/after snapshots for all resource modifications
- **User Attribution**: Clear identification of who performed each action
- **Append-only Records**: Audit trail for compliance and security

Learn more about audit logs and how to access them in our [documentation](/docs/audit-logs).

[Langfuse Prompt Management](/docs/prompts/get-started) now includes a detailed comparison of changes between prompt versions. This has been a [long-awaited](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1105) feature and we are excited to finally release it based on an initial contribution from [@chrispe](https://github.com/chrispe).

These comparisons/diffs are especially helpful when making lots of changes in a larger team in order to understand what has actually changed between versions.

You can now upload CSV files to create Dataset Items in Langfuse.

Simply drag and drop your CSV columns to map them to "input", "expected output", or "metadata" fields. Multiple columns can be combined into a single field - simply drag and drop all CSV columns you want to combine into the same field, which will automatically create a structured JSON object. Any columns that are not mapped will be ignored. The CSV should contain a header row with your column names. All schema types are supported, including nested JSON objects.

With Langfuse's Data Retention feature, you can control how long your event data (Traces, Observations, Scores, and Media Assets) is stored in Langfuse.D
ata retention is configured on a project level, and we accept a number of days with a minimum of 7 days.
Project owners and administrators can change the data retention setting within the Project Settings view.

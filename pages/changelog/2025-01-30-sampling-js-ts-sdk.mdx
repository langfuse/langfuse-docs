Trace sampling enables you to specify the proportion of traces that the SDK should collect and send to Langfuse. By adjusting the `sampleRate`, you can balance between comprehensive tracing and resource efficiency.

You can configure the sample rate using the constructor parameter or the environment variable.

**Using Constructor Parameters**

You can set the `sampleRate` when initializing the Langfuse client. The `sampleRate` should be a value between `0` and `1`, representing the share of traces to be sent to Langfuse.

```ts
import { Langfuse } from "langfuse";

const langfuse = new Langfuse({
  secretKey: "sk-lf-...",
  publicKey: "pk-lf-...",
  sampleRate: 0.2, // Samples 20% of the traces
});
```

**Using Environment Variables**

Alternatively, you can configure the sample rate via the `LANGFUSE_SAMPLE_RATE` environment variable. This method is useful for dynamic configurations without changing the codebase.

```bash filename=".env"
LANGFUSE_SAMPLE_RATE="0.2"
```

We've enhanced our editor with powerful new features, now available across [Prompt Management](/docs/prompts), [Datasets](/docs/datasets), and [Model Management](/docs/model-usage-and-cost).

What's new:

- Syntax highlighting for variables to easily spot template placeholders
- Tab-based organization for better content structure
- Real-time validation with inline warnings for invalid variable names and JSON syntax
- Line numbers for precise code reference and debugging

We've added a "Select All" option to table views in Langfuse. This makes it easier to perform bulk actions like deleting items or adding traces to annotation queues or datasets.

The feature is available in the traces table, but will be added to other tables in the future. When enabled, it selects all items across pages, not just the currently visible ones.

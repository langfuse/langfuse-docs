With the advent of agentic LLM applications, traces have grown increasingly complex, containing numerous reasoning steps and executions. To manage this complexity, you can now filter your trace view using observation log-levels (`DEBUG`, `DEFAULT`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`). This allows you to focus on the most critical observations in your trace tree. By toggling the visibility of observations, you can maintain a clear and digestible view of your trace data, making it easier to identify and analyze critical events.

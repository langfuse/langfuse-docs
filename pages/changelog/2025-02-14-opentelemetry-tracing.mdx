Langfuse now accepts spans from your OpenTelemetry instrumentation.
OpenTelemetry provides a vendor-neutral standard for distributed tracing with GenAI-specific semantic attributes.
This enables you to use Langfuse across more languages and frameworks than ever before.

Checkout our [OpenTelemetry documentation](/docs/opentelemetry/get-started) to get started or dive into the guides
for some of our newly supported libraries like [OpenLIT](/docs/opentelemetry/example-openlit) and [OpenLLMetry](/docs/opentelemetry/example-openllmetry).

New frameworks supported via the OpenTelemetry endpoint include:

- [Hugging Face smolagents](/docs/integrations/smolagents)
- [CrewAI](/docs/integrations/crewai)
- [AutoGen](/docs/integrations/autogen)
- [Semantic Kernel](/docs/integrations/semantic-kernel)
- [Pydantic AI](/docs/integrations/pydantic-ai)

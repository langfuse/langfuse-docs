OpenAI has released GPT-4.5, their largest and best model for chat yet. This research preview represents a significant advancement in scaling up pre-training and post-training capabilities.

Core features include (from [OpenAI release notes](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-4-5)):

- **Scaled Unsupervised Learning**: GPT-4.5 focuses on scaling unsupervised learning, improving its ability to recognize patterns, draw connections, and generate creative insights without reasoning.
- **Enhanced "EQ" and Reduced Hallucinations**: Early testing shows GPT-4.5 feels more natural to interact with, featuring a broader knowledge base, improved ability to follow user intent, and greater emotional intelligence. It's also expected to hallucinate less.
- **Deeper World Knowledge**: The model demonstrates significantly improved factual accuracy and knowledge depth compared to previous models, with benchmark tests showing substantial improvements over GPT-4o.
- **Natural Conversation**: GPT-4.5 integrates ideas naturally in warm and intuitive conversations that are more attuned to human collaboration, with better understanding of what humans mean and interpretation of subtle cues.

GPT-4.5 is a very large and compute-intensive model, making it more expensive than GPT-4o. Thus, [cost tracking](/docs/model-usage-and-cost) is essential when using it in production.

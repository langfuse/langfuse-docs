You can now permanently delete [dataset](/docs/datasets) items and runs through both the API and UI interfaces. This feature extends the existing archiving functionality, giving you more control over your data management. When you delete an item or run, it will be permanently removed from your dataset including all related information, freeing up space and helping you maintain a cleaner dataset environment.

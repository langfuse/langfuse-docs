[Langfuse Native Environments](/docs/tracing-features/environments) allow you to separate your staging, development, or production systems within a single Langfuse project.
This enables you to share prompts, datasets, and more within a project without mixing the source of your tracing data.

Read our [documentation page](/docs/tracing-features/environments) to learn how to label your traces with the environment they belong to.

If you have any questions or feedback, please share it in our [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/5005) or via our usual support channels.

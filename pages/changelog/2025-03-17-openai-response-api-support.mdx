OpenAI has released their new improved Response API for a better developer experience building agentic applications. We have added support for tracing OpenAI Response API executions in the OpenAI integrations in both our JS and Python SDK.

client = openai.OpenAI()

client.responses.create(

)

# Flush via global client
langfuse = get_client()
langfuse.flush()

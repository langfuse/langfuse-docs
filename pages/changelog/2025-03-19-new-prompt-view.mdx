We recently launched a redesigned [prompt view](/docs/prompts) to help you better manage, analyze, and optimize your prompts.

## What's New

Our new prompt view offers:

- **Enhanced Prompt Visualization**: Better readability with improved formatting for different prompt types
- **Advanced Filtering**: Find prompt versions by version number, commit message or prompt labels 
- **Side-by-Side Version Comparison**: Easily spot differences between prompt versions to track your iterations in a diff view 
- **Integrated with Design Language**: Part of our broader UI refresh for a more cohesive experience

## Why It Matters

Effective prompt management is crucial for LLM application development. This redesign makes it easier to iterate on prompts, understand their performance, and share them with your team.

We're excited to announce our redesigned [trace view](/docs/tracing), making it significantly easier to understand and analyze your application traces.

## Key Features

- **Improved Visualization and Navigation**: Clearer visual flow of overall trace and observation hierarchy and metrics, with detailed view of each trace and observation input output
- **Tree/Timeline Toggle**: Switch between chronological and hierarchical views that are now fully on par in terms of metrics and scores
- **Customizable View Settings**: Show/hide scores, comments, metrics, and enable color coding
- **Powerful Search**: Find observations by type, ID, or name
- **Refined Design Language**: Part of our broader effort to create a more sophisticated product

The new trace view is available now for all users. Navigate to any trace in your project to try it out!

## Introducing Table Peek View

We're excited to announce the release of the Traces Table Peek View, allowing you to quickly scan through traces and identify patterns. This view unlocks the ability to preview trace details directly from the table view without having to navigate away, saving you valuable time during debugging sessions.

- **Improved Workflow**: Stay in context while investigating multiple traces
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Efficiently move through traces with keyboard shortcuts

## How to Use the Table Peek View

1. Navigate to the traces table view
2. Click on any trace row you want to preview
3. A detailed preview panel will appear showing the essential information
4. Use keyboard shortcuts to navigate between traces:
   - Press `J` to move down to the next trace row
   - Press `K` to move up to the previous trace row
   - Press `Esc` to close the preview panel

We hope this new feature enhances your debugging experience! Let us know what you think in our feedback forum.

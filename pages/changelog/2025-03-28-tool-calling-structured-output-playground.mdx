The Langfuse Playground now supports tool calling and structured output schemas, enabling you to define, test, and validate LLM executions that rely on tool calls and enforce specific response formats.

**Tool Calling**

- Define custom tools with JSON schema definitions
- Test prompts relying on tools in real-time by mocking tool responses
- Save tool definitions to your project

**Structured Output**

- Enforce response formats using JSON schemas
- Save schemas to your project
- Jump into the playground from your OpenAI generation using structured output

Protected prompt labels give project admins and owners the ability to prevent labels from being modified or deleted, ensuring better control over prompt deployment.

Once a label such as `production` is marked as protected:

- `viewer` and `member` roles cannot modify or delete the label from prompts, preventing changes to the `production` prompt version.
- `admin` and `owner` roles can still modify or delete it, effectively changing the `production` prompt version

Admins and owners can update a label's protection status in the project settings.

**Availability**

Protected labels are available on all Team (Cloud) and Enterprise (Cloud and Self-Hosted) plans. Check your project settings and upgrade if needed to start using this feature.

<ChangelogHeader />

The new Langfuse Admin APIs allow you to create, update, and delete organizations, as well as manage projects and users within those organizations.
Users can create API keys with organization and project scope, which can be used to authenticate with the Langfuse API and access management routes for projects and users.
The user management endpoints are written in a [SCIM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7642) compatible way, which allows for easy integration with existing identity management systems.
We plan to expand SCIM support in upcoming releases.

**Getting Started**

To get started with the Organization Management API, you need to set the `ADMIN_API_KEY` environment variable in your self-hosted instance.
Set the `ADMIN_API_KEY` as a Bearer token for your requests, and you can start using the [Organization Management API](https://organizations-api.reference.langfuse.com/) to create a new organization and an organization API key.

With the organization API key, you can make use of the new administrative endpoints which are documented in [Admin API](/docs/admin-api).

**Availability**

The Organization Management API is only available for self-hosted instances.
The Admin API is available for self-hosted instances, and soon we'll add support for it on Langfuse Cloud.

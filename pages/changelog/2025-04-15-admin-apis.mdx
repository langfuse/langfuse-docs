## Organization Management API

**Availability:** Self-hosted (enterprise) instances only

The Organization Management API provides endpoints for creating and managing organizations in your Langfuse instance. To use this API:

1. Set the `ADMIN_API_KEY` environment variable in your self-hosted instance
2. Include this key as a Bearer token in your API requests
3. Use the endpoints to create organizations and organization API keys

This API enables full programmatic control over organization creation and management.

## Organization-level API Routes

**Availability:** Self-hosted (enterprise) instances, Langfuse Cloud support coming soon

The Langfuse API provides administrative endpoints for managing projects and users within organizations.
The user management endpoints follow [SCIM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7642) standards for seamless integration with existing identity management systems, with expanded SCIM support planned for future releases.

To use this API:

1. Obtain an organization API key through the Organization Management API
2. Use this key to authenticate with the Admin API endpoints
3. Manage projects, users, and access controls programmatically

These endpoints give organization administrators programmatic control over their Langfuse resources.

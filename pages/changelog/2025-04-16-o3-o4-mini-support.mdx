Some highlights about o3 and o4-mini from the [OpenAI release notes](https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini):
- **Improved Instruction Following**: Both models demonstrate enhanced instruction following and provide more useful, verifiable responses than their predecessors
- **More Natural Interaction**: Responses feel more conversational and personalized by leveraging memory and past conversation context

As OpenAIs best reasoning model yet, o3:
- **Advanced Reasoning**: o3 is OpenAI's most powerful reasoning model, setting new state-of-the-art benchmarks across coding, math, science, and visual perception
- **Reduced Error Rate**: Makes 20 percent fewer major errors than OpenAI o1 on difficult real-world tasks, especially in programming, business consulting, and creative ideation

o4-mini for cost-effective reasoning:
- **Cost-Effective Performance**: o4-mini achieves remarkable performance for its size and cost, particularly excelling in math, coding, and visual tasks
- **Higher Usage Capacity**: Supports significantly higher usage limits than o3, making it ideal for high-volume applications that benefit from reasoning

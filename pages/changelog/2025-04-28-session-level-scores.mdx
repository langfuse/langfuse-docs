<ChangelogHeader />

Langfuse now supports session-level scores, enabling comprehensive evaluation of conversational experiences across multiple interactions rather than just individual traces or observations.

## What's New

- **Session-Level Scoring**: Create and manage scores at the session level for holistic evaluation of conversational AI applications
- **Flexible API Design**: Updated APIs to accommodate both trace-level and session-level scoring needs
- **UI Enhancements**: Visual indicators and aggregates for session scores throughout the interface

## API Updates

We have added a new v2 api and will continue to support the v1 api for the foreseeable future.
POST and DELETE APIs will support both trace and session level scores across v1 and v2.

For GET APIs:

- **V1 API**: Only supports trace level scores, therefore requires `traceId` - to remain backwards compatible
- **V2 API**: Either `traceId` or `sessionId` is now required (but not both) when creating scores


## UI Improvements

- **Multi-Level Annotation**: Support for score annotations at trace, observation, and session levels
- **Sessions Table**: Added score aggregates to the sessions table view for quick assessment
- **Consistent Experience**: Unified scoring experience across all levels of your application

## Why Session Scores Matter

Session-level scores are particularly valuable for conversational applications where user satisfaction spans multiple interactions rather than individual exchanges. This enables more accurate evaluation of:

- Overall conversation quality
- Multi-turn interaction effectiveness
- End-to-end user experience metrics

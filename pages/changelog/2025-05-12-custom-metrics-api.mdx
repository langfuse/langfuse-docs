## Overview

We're excited to announce our new Metrics API, which allows you to build custom analytics dashboards and reports from your Langfuse data.
This flexible API enables you to construct queries with:

- Customizable dimensions and metrics
- Flexible time granularity (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)
- Advanced filtering capabilities including metadata filtering
- Support for both traces and observations views

## Key Features

- **Multiple Dimensions**: Group your data by any available dimension like name, model, or user ID
- **Flexible Metrics**: Select and aggregate metrics like count, latency (with various aggregations like p95, avg)
- **Time-Based Analysis**: Apply time dimensions with different granularities
- **Rich Filtering**: Filter by metadata, timestamps, and other properties
- **JSON-Based Query Format**: Intuitive query structure for complex analytics needs

## Example

Here's an example of querying the number of traces grouped by name:

```bash
curl \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <BASIC AUTH HEADER>" \
  -G \
  --data-urlencode 'query={
    "view": "traces",
    "metrics": [{"measure": "count", "aggregation": "count"}],
    "dimensions": [{"field": "name"}],
    "filters": [],
    "fromTimestamp": "2025-05-01T00:00:00Z",
    "toTimestamp": "2025-05-13T00:00:00Z"
  }' \
  https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/metrics
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": [
    { "name": "trace-test-2", "count_count": "10" },
    { "name": "trace-test-3", "count_count": "10" },
    { "name": "trace-test-1", "count_count": "10" }
  ]
}
```

We've added the ability to customize which product modules are visible in the main menu. This feature is particularly useful for organizations that want to focus on specific aspects of Langfuse or create a more streamlined user experience.

Added two new environment variables to control module visibility:

- `LANGFUSE_UI_VISIBLE_PRODUCT_MODULES`: Specify which modules should be visible
- `LANGFUSE_UI_HIDDEN_PRODUCT_MODULES`: Specify which modules should be hidden

If both variables are set, `LANGFUSE_UI_VISIBLE_PRODUCT_MODULES` takes precedence. If neither is set, all modules are visible by default.

Refer to the [UI Customization](/self-hosting/ui-customization#visibility) documentation for more information on how to configure these environment variables.

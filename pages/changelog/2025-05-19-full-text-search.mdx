**Day 1 of [Launch Week 3](/blog/2025-05-19-launch-week-3)** is here, and we're excited to announce the launch of full-text search. This feature has received one of the highest numbers of upvotes in our [feature requests](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/939), and we are thrilled to make it available. Finding all occurrences of a specific keyword or phrase across your Langfuse traces and observations can be extremely helpful.

See the video above for a quick tutorial.

<ChangelogHeader />

With **Day&nbsp;2 of [Launch Week #3](/blog/2025-05-19-launch-week-3)** we're making it easier to return to the exact slice of data you care about—and to bring your teammates along.

## What's new

• **Save a view** – After applying any combination of filters, column visibility, order, search strings, and sorting, simply hit "Save view" and give it a name.
• **Instant permalinks** – Every saved view gets its own URL. Share it in Slack, tickets, or dashboards — anyone opening the link lands on the same view.
• **One-click access** – Your project-wide views are listed in the table header so you can switch context without re-applying filters.
• **Edit & delete** – Flexibly update your saved view to reflect changes to the desired table settings. You can also rename or remove views as your workflow evolves.

## Why it matters

Saved views remove repetitive clicks and help teams stay on the same page:

• Jump straight to your "Failing traces", "High-latency traces", or "Scores below threshold" views every morning.
• Create views tailored to teams, roles, or workflows — without cluttering the default table.
• Share an investigation link when analyzing issues so everyone looks at the identical data subset.

## Where you'll find it

The feature is available today in all major tables: **Traces, Observations, Scores, Sessions, and Datasets**. It is enabled for every workspace and does not require additional setup.

## Looking ahead

We'll continue to refine the experience based on your feedback — comment on [this post](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/4657) or drop us a note by opening an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse).

Happy debugging!

Anthropic has released their latest models, Claude Sonnet 4 & Opus 4 with exciting new capabilities, from the [Anthropic release notes](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4):

- **Extended Thinking with Tool Use**: Both Claude Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 can utilize tools like web search during extended thinking, allowing them to alternate between reasoning and tool use for improved responses.
- **New Model Capabilities**: The models can execute tools in parallel, follow instructions more precisely, and demonstrate improved memory capabilities when given access to local files, enhancing continuity and tacit knowledge over time.

Langfuse supports both models with day 1 support for the LLM playground, LLM-as-a-judge and cost tracking.

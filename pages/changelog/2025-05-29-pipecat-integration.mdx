Thanks to a recent [PR](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat/pull/1729) by [@markbackman](https://github.com/markbackman), Pipecat now supports OpenTelemetry tracing.

We added a new [Pipecat integration guide](/integrations/frameworks/pipecat) demonstrating how to send Pipecat traces to Langfuse using OpenTelemetry. The guide includes a step-by-step walkthrough and a link to an end-to-end example.

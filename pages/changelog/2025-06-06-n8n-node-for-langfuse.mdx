We're excited to announce the availability of a community-maintained n8n node for Langfuse! This integration brings Langfuse's prompt management capabilities directly into your n8n workflows.

## What's New

The Langfuse n8n node provides seamless integration with [Langfuse's Prompt Management](/docs/prompts/get-started) in n8n workflows. Key features include:

- **Fetch Prompts**: Retrieve prompts from your Langfuse project with support for versioning and labels
- **Compile Templates**: Process prompt templates with variables to generate ready-to-use prompts
- **Version Control**: Access specific prompt versions or use labels like `production` and `latest`

## Installation

Install via **Settings** > **Community Nodes** using package name: `@langfuse/n8n-nodes-langfuse`

## Example Use Cases

- **Dynamic Prompt Fetching**: Use different prompts based on workflow context

If you have many prompts stored in Langfuse, you can now organize them into folders to keep them neatly organized.

Put a slash (/) in the prompt name to create a folder. For example, `folder1/prompt1` will create a folder named `folder1` and a prompt named `prompt1` inside it.
The folders are virtual so the full prompt name remains `folder1/prompt1` if you want to fetch it via the SDK.

**Note**: if you want to use this feature with the python SDK, please upgrade to at least version 3.0.2.

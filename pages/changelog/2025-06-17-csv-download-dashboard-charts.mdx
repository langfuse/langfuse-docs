You can now download the underlying data from any chart in your [custom dashboards](/docs/analytics/custom-dashboards) as CSV files for further analysis and reporting.

Simply hover over any chart and click the download button to get your CSV file. This makes it easy to create reports, perform custom analysis, or integrate dashboard data into your existing workflows.

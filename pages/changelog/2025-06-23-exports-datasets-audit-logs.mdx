You can now export [datasets](/docs/datasets) and [audit logs](/docs/audit-logs) directly from the UI. This feature makes it easier to analyze your data externally or create backups of important information.

**How to use:**

- Navigate to your datasets or audit logs table
- Click the export button on the top right
- Your data will be exported in a downloadable format

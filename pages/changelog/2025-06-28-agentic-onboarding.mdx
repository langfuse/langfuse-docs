To make the Langfuse docs more accessible to AI agents, we've added a new Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. This server is powered by the [Inkeep RAG API](https://docs.inkeep.com/ai-api/rag-mode/http-request). Inkeep powers [Langfuse Ask AI](/docs/ask-ai) and we are huge fans of their product.

Instead of manually integrating Langfuse into your existing codebase, you can now use agents like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf to automatically add tracing to your LLM applications.

## How it works

The new agentic onboarding approach consists of two key components:

1. **Langfuse Docs MCP Server**: A Model Context Protocol server that gives AI agents access to Langfuse documentation, ensuring they have the most up-to-date integration guidance.

2. **Integration Prompt**: A carefully crafted prompt that instructs the agent to analyze your codebase and add appropriate Langfuse tracing based on the LLM libraries and frameworks you're already using.

## Getting started

On the [Get Started page](/docs/get-started), you'll now find a new "âœ¨ Agentic" tab that provides:

- One-click MCP server installation for popular editors
- Step-by-step setup instructions for Cursor, GitHub Copilot in VSCode, Windsurf, and other MCP clients
- A ready-to-use prompt that you can copy and paste into your agent

The agent will automatically:

- Detect which LLM libraries you're using (OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, etc.)
- Choose the appropriate Langfuse integration method
- Add the necessary imports and configuration
- Wrap your existing LLM calls with Langfuse tracing

## Try it out

This feature is experimental, so results may vary depending on your codebase complexity. We'd love to hear your feedback and experiences on [GitHub](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/issues).

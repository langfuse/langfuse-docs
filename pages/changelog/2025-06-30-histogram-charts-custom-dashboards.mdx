We're excited to introduce **histogram charts** to Langfuse custom dashboards!
This new visualization option helps you understand the distribution of your data, making it easier to identify patterns, outliers, and trends in your LLM application metrics.

## What are Histogram Charts?

Histogram charts display the frequency distribution of continuous data by grouping values into bins.
Unlike bar charts that show discrete categories, histograms reveal the shape and spread of your data, helping you answer questions like:

- **Latency Analysis**: How are response times distributed across your application?
- **Cost Patterns**: What's the typical range of costs per request?
- **Score Distributions**: How are quality scores spread across different ranges?
- **Token Usage**: What's the distribution of input/output token consumption?

## Getting Started

Creating a histogram chart is simple:

1. Navigate to **Dashboards** → **Widgets** → **New Widget**
2. Select your data source (traces, observations, or scores)
3. Choose **Histogram** as your chart type
4. Select the metric you want to visualize (e.g., latency, cost, tokens)
5. Apply any filters to focus on specific data subsets
6. Save and add to your dashboard

With Message Placeholders, easily inject message histories (or other context) into chat prompts at defined positions.
Add a placeholder message in your chat prompt and fill it in with a list of chat messages in the SDKs.
You can also try it in the playground, add a placeholder and provide a list of chat messages to fill in below the variables.

In the SDKs, you can fill in values for placeholders by calling the `update(placeholders={"key": ChatMessage[]})` method.
You can chain that call with further processing, such as `.update(...).getLangchainPrompt()`.

**Note**: to use Message placeholders with SDKs, you need to run at least `langfuse-python >= 3.0.9` or `langfuse-js >= 3.37.7`.

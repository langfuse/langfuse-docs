We're excited to introduce **pivot tables** to Langfuse custom dashboards!
This new widget type enables multi-dimensional analysis of your LLM application data, making it easier to uncover patterns and insights across different segments and metrics.

## What are Pivot Tables?

Pivot tables provide a flexible way to summarize and analyze data by organizing it into rows, columns, and values.
They excel at revealing relationships between multiple dimensions simultaneously, helping you answer complex analytical questions like:

- **Cross-Model Performance**: How do latency and cost metrics compare across different models and user segments?
- **Feature Analysis**: Which features drive the highest quality scores across different time periods?
- **User Behavior Patterns**: How do usage patterns vary by user type, geography, and application features?
- **Quality vs. Cost Trade-offs**: What's the relationship between model costs and quality scores across different use cases?

## Getting Started

Creating a pivot table is straightforward:

1. Navigate to **Dashboards** → **Widgets** → **New Widget**
2. Select your data source (traces, observations, or scores)
3. Choose **Pivot Table** as your chart type
4. Configure your pivot table:
   - **Metrics**: Select which metrics you want to plot, e.g. different latency percentiles
   - **Dimensions**: Select up to two dimensions that you want to group by
5. Apply filters to narrow down your analysis
6. Save and add to your dashboard

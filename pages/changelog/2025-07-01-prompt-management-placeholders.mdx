With Message Placeholders, easily inject message histories (or other context) into chat prompts at defined positions.
Add a placeholder message in your chat prompt and fill it in with a list of chat messages in the SDKs.
You can also try it in the playground, add a placeholder and provide a list of chat messages to fill in below the variables.

In the SDKs, you can fill in values for placeholders by calling the `compile(variables, placeholders)` method.
To get a Langchain compatible prompt, use the `getLangchainPrompt(...)` method.
Unresolved placeholders will be returned as a Langchain `MessagesPlaceholder` object for further processing.

**Note**: to use Message placeholders with SDKs, you need to run at least `langfuse-python >= 3.0.10` or `langfuse-js >= 3.37.7`.

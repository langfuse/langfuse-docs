<ChangelogHeader />

Some teams manage thousands of prompts in Langfuse [Prompt Management](/docs/prompts/get-started). Recently we introduced [folders](/docs/prompts/get-started#folders) to help organize these collections. Today we add search across prompt names and tags to further improve the experience.

## Get started

import { Book } from "lucide-react";

<Cards num={1}>
  <Card title="Prompt Management Documentation" href="/docs/get-started/test-a-prompt" icon={<Book />} />

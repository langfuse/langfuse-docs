Google has expanded their Gemini 2.5 family of models with stable releases and new additions. From [Google release notes](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-2-5-model-family-expands):

- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Now generally available - Advanced model with enhanced reasoning capabilities, optimized for complex tasks and coding
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: Now generally available - Faster, cost-effective variant with 1M token context window, designed for high-volume applications while maintaining strong performance
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite**: New model in preview - Google's most cost-efficient and fastest 2.5 model yet, with all-around higher quality than 2.0 Flash-Lite on coding, math, science, reasoning and multimodal benchmarks

All three models are now available in the Langfuse Playground for interactive testing and in LLM-as-a-judge evals. Additionally, we've added cost tracking support for both Gemini 2.5 Flash and Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite to help you monitor your usage.

(Gemini 2.5 Pro pricing is tiered by context window size and thus not yet supported for automatic cost tracking in Langfuse.)

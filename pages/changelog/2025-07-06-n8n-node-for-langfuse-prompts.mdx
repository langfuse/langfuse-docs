We're excited to announce the availability of a community-maintained n8n node for Langfuse! This integration brings Langfuse's prompt management capabilities directly into your n8n workflows.

> What is n8n? [n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) is an open‑source, node‑based workflow automation platform that lets you visually connect and orchestrate APIs, apps, and data without writing full code.

## What's New

The Langfuse n8n node provides seamless integration with [Langfuse's Prompt Management](/docs/prompts/get-started) in n8n workflows. Key features include:

- **Fetch Prompts**: Retrieve prompts from your Langfuse project with support for versioning and labels
- **Compile Templates**: Process prompt templates with variables to generate ready-to-use prompts
- **Version Control**: Access specific prompt labels like `production` and `latest`

When using Langfuse [Prompt Management](/docs/prompts/get-started), you can now receive real-time notifications when prompts are changed:

- **Created** - A new prompt version is added
- **Updated** - Labels or tags on an existing prompt version are modified
- **Deleted** - A prompt version is removed

Common use cases:

- Trigger CI/CD pipelines when production prompts are updated
- Sync prompt changes with external systems or persist them in your repo via a GitHub Action
- Notify team members about prompt modifications

## Features

- **Filtering**: Configure webhooks for specific prompt actions with custom filters
- **Security**: HMAC SHAâ€‘256 signature verification via `x-langfuse-signature` header
- **Reliability**: High availability with error handling and retry mechanisms

## Setup

1. Navigate to **Webhooks** in your Langfuse project
2. Click **Create Webhook**
3. Select which prompt version actions should trigger the webhook
4. Configure your HTTP endpoint URL and optional headers
5. Add any desired filters to narrow the scope
6. Save and start receiving real-time notifications

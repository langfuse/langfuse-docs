<ChangelogHeader />

Self-hosted Langfuse deployments can now leverage the **AWS SDK default credential provider chain** when connecting to Amazon Bedrock for LLM operations inside the Langfuse platform (e.g. [playground](/docs/playground), [evals](/docs/scores/model-based-evals)).

**What's New**

Previously, self-hosted deployments required explicit AWS credentials (access key and secret key) to connect to Amazon Bedrock. Now you can use any of the AWS SDK's default credential sources:

- **IAM roles** for EC2 instances
- **ECS task roles** for containerized deployments
- **AWS profiles** from `~/.aws/credentials`
- **Environment variables** (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)

**Benefits**

- **Simplified deployment**: No need to manage explicit credentials in your configuration
- **Enhanced security**: Follow AWS security best practices with IAM roles
- **Flexible authentication**: Use the most appropriate credential method for your deployment environment
- **Seamless integration**: Works with existing AWS infrastructure and security policies

**Usage**

When configuring Amazon Bedrock connections in your self-hosted deployment, you can now omit the explicit AWS credentials and let the SDK automatically discover them through the default provider chain.

**Availability**

This feature is available from Langfuse platform image version 3.83.0

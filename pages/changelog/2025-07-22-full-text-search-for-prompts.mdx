We've enhanced prompt discovery in [Prompt Management](/docs/get-started/prompts) with full-text search capabilities. While you could previously search by prompt names and tags, you can now search through the actual content of your prompts to find exactly what you're looking for.

This is especially valuable for teams managing large prompt libraries where remembering specific prompt names or tags isn't always practical. Now you can search for specific instructions, examples, or any text within your prompts to quickly locate the right one.

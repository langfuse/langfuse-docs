<ChangelogHeader />

You can now trigger external experiment pipelines directly from the Langfuse UI. This feature enables non-technical users to run experiments on [Datasets](/docs/datasets) without requiring code changes or manual setup.

Configure a remote experiment URL at the dataset level, and team members can trigger experiments with a single click. Langfuse will send the dataset name, ID, and any custom payload to your experiment service, then wait up to 10 seconds for a response.

## Features

- **Dataset-level configuration**: Set up experiment URLs and custom payloads per dataset
- **Simple triggering**: One-click experiment execution from the UI
- **Custom payloads**: Send additional context or parameters to your experiment service
- **Response handling**: 10-second timeout with status feedback

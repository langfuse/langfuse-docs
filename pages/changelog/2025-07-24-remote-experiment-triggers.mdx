<ChangelogHeader />

You can now trigger external experiment pipelines directly from the Langfuse UI. This feature enables non-technical users to run experiments on [Datasets](/docs/datasets) without requiring code changes or manual setup.

Configure a remote experiment URL at the dataset level, and team members can trigger experiments with a single click. Langfuse will send the dataset name, ID, and any custom payload to your experiment service, then wait up to 10 seconds for a response.

## Features

- **Dataset-level configuration**: Set up experiment URLs and custom payloads per dataset
- **Simple triggering**: One-click experiment execution from the UI
- **Custom payloads**: Send additional context or parameters to your experiment service
- **Response handling**: 10-second timeout with status feedback

## Setup

1. Navigate to your **Dataset** in Langfuse. In the top right corner of your **Dataset Runs** page, click **New Experiment**
2. Configure the **Remote Experiment URL** where your experiment service is hosted
3. Add any **Custom Payload** (JSON format) needed by your experiment runner

## Triggering an experiment

1. Click **New Experiment** in the top right corner of the dataset runs page. Click the **Run** button
2. Confirm your payload, and click **Run** again to send dataset details to your service

## Integration

Your remote experiment service will receive:
- Dataset name and ID
- Custom payload (if configured)

Ideally, your experiment runner uses [Langfuse SDKs](/docs/sdk/overview) to push dataset run and evaluation results back to Langfuse for complete experiment tracking.

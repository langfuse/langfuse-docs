<ChangelogHeader />

We've added a new [LiveKit Agents integration guide](/integrations/frameworks/livekit) that shows how to trace real-time voice AI applications built with LiveKit Agents using Langfuse.

[LiveKit Agents](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/) is an open-source Python and Node.js framework for building production-grade multimodal and voice AI agents. The integration leverages LiveKit's built-in OpenTelemetry support to send comprehensive telemetry data to Langfuse.

The integration captures traces for key agent activities including:

- Session management
- Agent turns and conversations
- LLM node executions
- Function tool calls
- Text-to-speech processing
- End-of-turn detection
- Performance metrics

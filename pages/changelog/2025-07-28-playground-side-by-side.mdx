Compare multiple prompt variants alongside each other. Execute them all at once or focus on a single variant. Each variant keeps its own LLM settings, variables, tool definitions, and placeholders so you can immediately see the impact of every change.

Duplicate the current setup with one click or start from scratch. When youâ€™re satisfied, save the variant straight to Prompt Management as a new version in your project.

## Get started

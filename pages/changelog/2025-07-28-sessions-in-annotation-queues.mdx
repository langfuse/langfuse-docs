<ChangelogHeader />

We have added session-level annotation support in Langfuse Annotation Queues. This extends our annotation workflow capabilities to handle multi-turn interactions, making it particularly valuable for evaluating conversational AI applications.

## What's New

- **Evaluate Full Interactions**: Annotate complete multi-turn interactions rather than single turn interactions
- **Conversational Context**: Maintain conversation flow and context when reviewing and scoring LLM responses
- **Efficient Processing**: Manage annotation tasks at the appropriate granularity for your use case

<ChangelogHeader />

We have added session-level annotation support in Langfuse Annotation Queues. This extends our annotation workflow capabilities to handle multi-turn interactions, making it particularly valuable for evaluating conversational AI applications.

## What's New

Previously, Annotation Queues focused on individual traces. Now you can add entire sessions to annotation queues, enabling you to:

- **Evaluate Full Conversations**: Annotate complete multi-turn conversations rather than isolated interactions
- **Conversational Context**: Maintain conversation flow and context when reviewing and scoring LLM responses
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Process conversational data more efficiently with session-level organization

## Key Benefits for Conversational Use Cases

- **Enhanced Context**: Reviewers can see the full conversation history when making annotation decisions
- **Improved Consistency**: Session-level scoring ensures evaluation considers the entire interaction flow
- **Better Insights**: Generate more meaningful evaluation datasets for conversational AI applications
- **Efficient Processing**: Manage annotation tasks at the appropriate granularity for your use case

This update builds upon our existing Annotation Queue capabilities while extending support to session-based workflows, making it easier to maintain high-quality standards for conversational AI applications.

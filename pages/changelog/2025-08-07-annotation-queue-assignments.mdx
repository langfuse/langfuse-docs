We've added user assignment functionality to Langfuse Annotation Queues. This feature allows you to assign team members to specific queues, improving workflow organization and ensuring the right people are working on the most relevant annotation tasks. Assigned queues appear highlighted at the top of the annotation queue table, providing clear visibility into priority workstreams.

## What's New

- **User Assignment**: Assign multiple team members to specific annotation queues for better workflow management
- **Priority Visibility**: Assigned queues appear highlighted at the top of the queue table, making it easy to identify priority tasks
- **Scalable Search**: Advanced user search functionality handles organizations with thousands of users efficiently
- **Access Control**: Only valid project members can be assigned to queues

## Key Benefits

- **Improved Focus**: Team members can quickly identify queues they're assigned to work on
- **Better Organization**: Highlight relevant queues without restricting access to others
- **Scalable Management**: Efficiently manage assignments across large teams and organizations

## Management Options

- **UI Management**: Assign users directly through the Langfuse web interface with intuitive search and selection
- **API Access**: Programmatically manage queue assignments using our REST API endpoints

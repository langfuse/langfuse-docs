<ChangelogHeader />

You can now fetch the Markdown source of any docs page by appending `.md` to the URL.

Example: `/docs` â†’ [`/docs.md`](https://langfuse.com/docs.md)

From now on this powers:

- [Copy as Markdown](/changelog/2025-04-17-copy-as-markdown): now faster and more reliable
- [Langfuse Docs MCP Server](/docs/docs-mcp): new `getLangfuseDocsPage` tool

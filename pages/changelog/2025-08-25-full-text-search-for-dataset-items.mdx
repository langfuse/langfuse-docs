We've enhanced dataset item discovery in [Dataset Management](/docs/evaluation/dataset-runs/datasets) with full-text search capabilities. Hereby we've unlocked searching through the actual content of your dataset items to find exactly what you're looking for. Search will consider matches in item inputs, expected outputs or metadata. 

Effective evaluation requires datasets containing thousands or tens of thousands of items. Searching items for dataset management allows to search for specific examples, or any metadata within your items to seamlessly manage your dataset.

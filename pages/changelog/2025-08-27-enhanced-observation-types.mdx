<ChangelogHeader />

We've expanded the supported observation types to bring more meaning to your spans. Now, you can easily identify the type of action an observation represents, such as tool calls, embeddings or agents.

For most [integrations with agent frameworks](/docs/integrations) the observation types are automatically detected. You can also manually set them via the Langfuse SDK as explained in the [docs](/docs/observability/features/observation-types)

### Full List of Available Observation Types:

<Callout type="info">
  Setting new observation types requires Python SDK `version>=3.3.1`. Support
  for the JS SDK will land in [version
  4.0](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/8403).

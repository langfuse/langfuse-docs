You can now update your score configurations. Previously, once you created a score config, you couldn't change it. Now you can modify them anytime while keeping all your existing data safe.

## What's Changed

- **You can now update score configs**: Modify names, data types, and value ranges of existing configurations
- **Available via API/SDK and UI**: Update configs programmatically through the API/SDK or directly in the Langfuse interface
- **Your existing data stays safe**: All current scores remain unchanged when you update a config
- **Clear update rules**: New scores follow the updated configuration

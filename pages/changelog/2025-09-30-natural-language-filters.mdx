You can now construct filters for traces and observations using natural language.
Instead of manually building complex filters, simply describe what you're looking for in plain English and Langfuse will automatically construct the appropriate filters.
You can then refine the generated filters manually if needed.

## Examples

- "Find all default level traces with latency greater than 2 seconds"
- "Show me traces with errors from production"
- "Filter for traces with over 9000 tokens"


## How to Enable

This feature requires an organization-level opt-in setting that can be enabled by organization owners and admins in **Organization Settings** → **General** → **AI Features**. Learn more about [data privacy and security](/docs/security/ai-features).
In short:
- Processed by AWS Bedrock in your AWS region (they have zero retention, don't train)
- Retains any applicable compliance (HIPAA, SOC2, GDPR, ISO 27001)
- Traced by Langfuse Cloud in your region only
- No training on any data, no sharing with model developers

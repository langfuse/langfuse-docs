The `/api/public/traces` endpoint now supports advanced JSON-based filtering through a new `filter` parameter, enabling more sophisticated and flexible trace queries.

## Key features

- **JSON-encoded filtering**: Pass complex filter objects supporting datetime, string, number, and array filter types
- **Full backward compatibility**: Legacy query parameters continue to work; advanced filters take precedence when both are provided
- **Schema validation**: Built-in validation ensures filter parameters are correctly formatted
- **Filter merging**: Advanced and legacy filters can be combined seamlessly

This enhancement allows you to perform more precise data retrieval from the public API while maintaining compatibility with existing integrations.

We've added spend alerts on Langfuse Cloud to help you monitor your organization's spending and avoid unexpected costs.
Navigate to your organization settings and the **Billing** tab to configure spend alerts.

Spend alerts allow you to set custom monetary thresholds and receive email notifications when your organization's cloud spending exceeds those limits. This gives you better control over your costs and helps you manage your budget effectively.

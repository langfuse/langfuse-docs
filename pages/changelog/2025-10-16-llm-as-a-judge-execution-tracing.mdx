title: LLM-as-a-Judge Execution Tracing & Enhanced Observability
description: Every LLM evaluation execution now creates a trace, allowing you to inspect the exact prompts, responses, and token usage for each evaluation. Plus improved error handling and retry logic for better reliability.

<ChangelogHeader />

We're excited to announce a major enhancement to Langfuse's LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations: **full tracing of evaluation executions**. Every time an evaluation runs, we now create a detailed trace that captures the complete LLM interaction, giving you unprecedented visibility into how your evaluations are performing.

**What's New**

Every LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation execution is linked to a Langfuse trace of the underlying LLM call. This means you can:

- **Debug evaluation prompts**: See exactly what prompt was sent to the judge LLM
- **Inspect model responses**: View the complete response including score and reasoning
- **Monitor token usage**: Track costs and performance for each evaluation execution
- **Trace evaluation history**: Navigate from any score back to its source LLM interaction

**How to access execution traces**: There are four ways to navigate to an evaluation execution trace:

1. **Score tooltip in trace view**: For LLM-as-a-Judge scores, hover over any score badge and click "View execution trace"

2. **Tracing table**: Filter the environment to `langfuse-llm-as-a-judge` to view all evaluation execution traces

3. **Scores table**: Enable the "Execution Trace" column in the scores table to see all evaluation executions

4. **Evaluator logs table**: View execution trace IDs in the evaluator logs for detailed execution history

</Frame>

**Why This Matters**

Previously, debugging failed evaluations or understanding why a judge gave a particular score required guesswork. Now, with full tracing:

1. **Trust your evaluations**: Verify that the judge received the correct input and made sound judgments
2. **Optimize costs**: Identify expensive evaluation patterns and optimize your prompts
3. **Faster debugging**: Instantly see what went wrong when an evaluation fails
4. **Audit trail**: Complete history of every evaluation decision for compliance and analysis

**Getting Started**

This feature is automatically enabled for all LLM-as-a-Judge evaluators. Simply navigate to your evaluator logs to start exploring execution traces.

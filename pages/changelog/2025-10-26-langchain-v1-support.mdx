<ChangelogHeader />

We're happy to announce that Langfuse now supports Langchain v1 in both the Python SDK (>=3.8.0) and the JS/TS SDK (>=4.3.0).

The integration has remained largely stable and continues to use the `CallbackHandler` pattern for both Python and JavaScript/TypeScript implementations. **No changes are required to your existing instrumentation code** - your current Langchain integrations will continue to work seamlessly.

## What's supported

- **Python SDK**: Langchain v1 support in Langfuse Python SDK >=3.8.0
- **JS/TS SDK**: Langchain v1 support in Langfuse JS SDK >=4.3.0
- Full backward compatibility with existing code
- Same `CallbackHandler` pattern for instrumentation

Organize your datasets into folders for easier handling of large numbers of datasets.

Put a slash (/) in the dataset name to create a folder. For example, `folder1/dataset1` will create a folder named `folder1` and a dataset named `dataset1` inside it.
The folders are virtual so the full dataset name remains `folder1/dataset1` if you want to access it via the SDK or API.

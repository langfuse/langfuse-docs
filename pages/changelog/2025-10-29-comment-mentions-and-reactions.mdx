Comments now support @mentions and emoji reactions, making it easier to collaborate with your team directly in Langfuse. Tag teammates to bring their attention to specific sessions,traces, observations, or prompts, and use reactions to quickly acknowledge insights without adding another comment.

## What's New

- **@mention autocomplete**: Type `@` in any comment to see a list of your project members and tag them instantly
- **Email notifications**: Mentioned teammates receive email notifications with context about the comment and object
- **Emoji reactions**: Add quick reactions to comments to acknowledge feedback, agree with findings, or simply show appreciation
- **Notification preferences**: Control when you receive email notifications for mentions on a per-project basis

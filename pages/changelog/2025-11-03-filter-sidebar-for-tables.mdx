**Day 1 of [Launch Week 4](/blog/2025-10-29-launch-week-4)** is here, and we're excited to announce the new filter sidebar for tables.

## The Filter Sidebar

We've made filters a lot more accessible and intuitive with the new filter sidebar.

You can now filter for most column values with one click. The values are sorted by number of occurrences when in the `SELECT` mode.
For those columns, we show the number of occurrences within the selected time range.

More complex filters (such as "contains" and "does not contain") are still available and can be chained together by selecting the `TEXT` mode.

Previously created "Saved Views" continue to work and new "Saved Views" can still be created from the filter sidebar.

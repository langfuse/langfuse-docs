Easily filter tables with the new filter sidebar.

## What's New

We've made filters a lot more accessible and intuitive with the new filter sidebar.
Most column values can be filtered with one click for values sorted by number of occurrences in the `SELECT` mode.
For those columns, we show the number of occurrences within the selected time range.
More complex filters (such as "contains" and "does not contain") are still available and can be chained by selecting the `TEXT` mode.
Previously created "Saved Views" continue to work and new "Saved Views" can still be created from the filter sidebar.

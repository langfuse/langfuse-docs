This enables a more seamless authentication experience where users can click on the Langfuse application tile in their identity provider's dashboard and be automatically authenticated.

## How It Works

When configuring IdP-initiated SSO, you'll set up your identity provider to redirect users to:

```
<YOUR_LANGFUSE_INSTANCE_URL>/auth/sso-initiate?provider=<PROVIDER>
```

Langfuse will automatically detect the provider and initiate the SSO authentication flow. Users see a brief loading screen while being redirected to their identity provider for authentication.

## Get Started

**On Langfuse Cloud:** Reach out to [support](/support) to configure IdP-initiated SSO for your identity provider.

**When self-hosting:** See the [self-hosted SSO documentation](/self-hosting/security/authentication-and-sso#idp-initiated-sso) for configuration instructions. IdP-initiated SSO is available on version `>=v3.126.0` of Langfuse.

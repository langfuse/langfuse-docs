On day 2 of [**Langfuse Launch Week 4**](/blog/2025-10-29-launch-week-4), we roll out this integration. You can configure it within your project settings by selecting your Mixpanel region and providing your Mixpanel Project Token. When activated, Langfuse sends metrics related to traces, generations, and scores to Mixpanel.

This integration makes it easy to combine your regular product analytics with the LLM-specific metrics that Langfuse generates. This way, you can answer questions like:

- _"Are my most active users also the ones who are most engaged with my LLM content?"_
- _"Does interacting with the LLM feature relate to higher retention rates?"_
- _"How does the LLM feature impact my conversion rates?"_
- _"Does the user feedback that I capture in Langfuse correlate with the user behavior that I see in Mixpanel?"_

Langfuse will sync all historical data from your project to Mixpanel, and after the initial sync, new data is automatically synced every hour (with a 30-minute delay) to keep your Mixpanel dashboards up to date.

We've enabled the integration for the [Langfuse example project](/demo) and created a dashboard using the `AI Company Metrics` template by Mixpanel. You can view the dashboard [here](https://eu.mixpanel.com/p/V92wFA5YwNjKn9K9vcUmAX).

If you're using PostHog instead of Mixpanel, we also offer a [similar integration for PostHog](/integrations/analytics/posthog) that integrates LLM metrics into your PostHog dashboards.

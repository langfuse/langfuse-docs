Drill down into your data faster. You can now filter the Compare View to show only specific experiment items, allowing you to focus on the subset that matters most.

**What's New**

The experiment compare view now supports filtering. Use filters to narrow down results based on specific criteria, such as evaluator scores, cost, latency, or other metrics. For instance, filter to show only items where your evaluator scores dropped below a threshold, making it easy to identify and address problematic cases.

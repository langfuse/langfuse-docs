Drill down into your data faster. You can now filter the Compare View to show only specific experiment items, allowing you to focus on the subset that matters most.

**What's New**

The experiment compare view now supports filtering. Use filters to narrow down results based on specific criteria, such as evaluator scores, cost, latency, or other metrics. For instance, filter to show only items where your evaluator scores dropped below a threshold, making it easy to identify and address problematic cases.

## Focus on What Matters

</Frame>

Filter experiment results to:

- **Identify regressions**: Show only items where scores decreased compared to baseline
- **Find high-cost cases**: Filter by cost thresholds to identify expensive executions
- **Review failures**: Focus on items that failed specific evaluators
- **Analyze performance**: Filter by latency ranges to understand performance patterns

## Getting Started

1. Open the compare view for your experiment runs
2. Use the filter controls to set your criteria
3. Review the filtered subset of results
4. Combine with [baseline comparison](/changelog/2025-11-06-compare-view-baseline-support) to systematically identify regressions

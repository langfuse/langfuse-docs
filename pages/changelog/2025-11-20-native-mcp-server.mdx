We're excited to announce that Langfuse now includes a **native MCP server** built directly into the platform. This eliminates the need for external repositories and build steps while adding powerful write capabilities that enable AI agents to create and manage prompts programmatically.

## What's New

The native MCP server is available at `/api/public/mcp` and provides five tools for comprehensive prompt management:

**Read Operations:**
- `getPrompt` - Fetch specific prompts by name, label, or version
- `listPrompts` - Browse all prompts with filtering and pagination

**Write Operations:**
- `createTextPrompt` - Create new text prompt versions
- `createChatPrompt` - Create new chat prompt versions (OpenAI-style messages)
- `updatePromptLabels` - Manage labels across prompt versions

All write operations include automatic audit logging, giving you full visibility into changes made by AI agents.

## Simplified Setup

No more cloning repositories or running build commands. Simply configure your MCP client with BasicAuth credentials:

```bash
# Claude Code - one command
claude mcp add --transport http langfuse https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/mcp \
    --header "Authorization: Basic {your-base64-token}"
```

The native server uses a stateless architecture, ensuring clean separation between projects and reliable operation across all deployment types (Cloud, self-hosted, or local development).

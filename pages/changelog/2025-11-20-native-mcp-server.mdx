<ChangelogHeader />

We're excited to announce that Langfuse now includes a **native MCP server** built directly into the platform. We release it with support for [Prompt Management](/docs/prompt-management/overview) and will extend it to the rest of the Langfuse data platform in the future.

Our previous Prompt MCP server ([changelog](/changelog/2025-02-16-mcp-server-update)) was a node package. The new one uses `StreamableHttp` to communicate with the Langfuse API directly, no need for building or installing any external dependencies.

## What's New

The native MCP server is available at `/api/public/mcp` and provides five tools for comprehensive prompt management:

**Read Operations:**

- `getPrompt` - Fetch specific prompts by name, label, or version
- `listPrompts` - Browse all prompts with filtering and pagination

**Write Operations:**

- `createTextPrompt` - Create new text prompt versions
- `createChatPrompt` - Create new chat prompt versions (OpenAI-style messages)
- `updatePromptLabels` - Manage labels across prompt versions

## Setup

Simply configure your MCP client with BasicAuth credentials:

```bash
# Claude Code - one command
claude mcp add --transport http langfuse https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/mcp \
    --header "Authorization: Basic {your-base64-token}"
```

The native server uses a stateless architecture, ensuring clean separation between projects and reliable operation across all deployment types (Cloud, self-hosted, or local development).

See [documentation](/docs/api-and-data-platform/features/mcp-server) for more details.

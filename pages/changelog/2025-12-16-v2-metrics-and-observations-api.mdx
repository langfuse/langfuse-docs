<ChangelogHeader />

We're releasing new **v2 endpoints** for our Metrics and Observations APIs, designed from the ground up for performance at scale.

<Callout type="warning">

The v2 APIs are currently in **beta**. They are stable for production use, but some parameters and behaviors may evolve based on user feedback before general availability.

**Important:** With current SDK versions, data may take approximately 5 minutes to appear on v2 endpoints. We will be releasing updated SDK versions soon that will make data available immediately on v2 endpoints.

</Callout>

## Why v2?

The v1 `/public/traces` and `/public/observations` endpoints have been among the most resource-intensive APIs to serve. After analyzing usage patterns, we identified several opportunities to dramatically reduce query overhead:

1. **No single way to request partial data** - The v1 API always returns complete rows with I/O, usage, and metadata even when only a few fields are needed. Traces v1 endpoint supports `fields` parameter, but it is too coarse-grained.
2. **Offset pagination doesn't scale** - Page-based pagination makes database do more work than strictly necessary.
3. **JSON parsing is expensive** - Automatic JSON parsing of input/output adds overhead even when raw strings suffice

The v2 APIs address all of these issues. Additionally, v2 is built on top of a new immutable data model that is inherently faster - it requires fewer joins and eliminates the need for deduplication at query time.

## What's New

### Metrics API v2

```
GET /api/public/v2/metrics
```

Built on an optimized data model, the v2 Metrics API delivers significantly faster query performance.

**The `traces` view is no longer available in v2.** Instead, use the `observations` view which is both faster and more powerful. Most trace-level analytics can be achieved by grouping observations by `traceId` - for example, get total cost per trace by grouping on `traceId` and summing `totalCost`.

### Observations API v2

```
GET /api/public/v2/observations
```

A redesigned endpoint for high-performance observation retrieval:

- **Selective field retrieval** - Specify which field groups you need (e.g., `core`, `basic`, `io`, `usage`). Defaults to `core` and `basic` if not specified
- **Cursor-based pagination** - Consistent performance regardless of pagination depth
- **Optimized I/O handling** - Returns I/O as strings by default; set `parseIoAsJson: true` only when needed
- **Stricter limits** - Default limit of 50 (max 1,000). With cursor based pagination, large result sets can be efficiently retrieved in smaller chunks, while less work is required per chunk.

## Migration Notes

The v2 APIs are additive - v1 endpoints remain available and unchanged. When ready to migrate:

1. Update your API calls to use `/api/public/v2/` prefix
2. Use the `fields` parameter to specify which field groups you need
3. Replace page-based pagination with cursor-based pagination
4. Note that `parseIoAsJson` defaults to `false` in v2 (v1 always parsed I/O as JSON)

**Using v1 `/api/public/traces`?** Consider v2 `/api/public/v2/observations` instead - it's significantly faster and covers most use cases.

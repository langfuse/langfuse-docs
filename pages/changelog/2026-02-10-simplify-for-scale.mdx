<ChangelogHeader />

We're rebuilding Langfuse's infrastructure to deliver the best performance especially for large projects. After processing billions of events per month, we've identified exactly where bottlenecks occur at scale—and we're eliminating them.

The result? **Instant charts. Lightning-fast APIs. A simpler, more intuitive data model.** Everything you love about Langfuse, now built to scale.

## What you'll get

### A simpler, more intuitive data model

No more confusion between traces and observations. Everything is now an **observation**—a single, unified concept that's easier to understand and work with.

Set context like `user_id`, `session_id`, and `metadata` once, and it automatically flows through all your spans. No more repeatedly updating trace metadata or patching outputs. Your instrumentation gets simpler and your mental model gets clearer.

### Snappier UI across the board

Charts that used to take seconds now load **instantly**. Filtering through millions of observations is smooth and fast.

We've eliminated the expensive database operations that caused slowdowns. Whether you're exploring complex agentic traces or analyzing production patterns, the UI keeps up with your thinking.

### Blazing fast APIs with our new v2 endpoints

Retrieve your data faster than ever with our redesigned APIs:

- **New Observations API v2**: Optimized for performance with flexible filtering and streamlined responses
- **New Metrics API v2**: Lightning-fast aggregations across millions of events

These aren't just incremental improvements—we're talking **10-100x faster** for common queries. Export data, build dashboards, integrate with your tools—everything gets faster.


### Nearly instant LLM-as-a-judge evaluations

Previously, database query overhead added significant latency to every evaluation execution. Each eval required querying ClickHouse, creating bottlenecks that limited throughput and slowed down evaluation workflows.

With the new architecture, we've eliminated these database bottlenecks. Evaluations now run on observations directly, enabling us to:

- **Evaluate at scale**: Run evals on each and every observation without performance degradation
- **Near-instant execution**: LLM-as-a-judge evaluations are now only bottlenecked by LLM API rate limits, not our infrastructure
- **Higher throughput**: Process evaluations in parallel at much higher concurrency

## How we did it

We rebuilt Langfuse around three core principles:

**Immutable by default**: Observations are written once and never modified. This eliminates expensive deduplication operations that slowed down queries.

**No joins required**: Trace-level attributes are propagated directly onto observations in the SDK, so queries run on a single table with no costly joins.

**Observations first**: Observations become the single source of truth, simplifying everything from APIs to UI.


## Upgrade to unlock the performance

To experience these improvements, upgrade to the latest SDK:

- **Python SDK**: Version 3.0.0 or higher
- **JS/TS SDK**: Version 4.0.0 or higher

<Callout type="info">
Set trace-level attributes (`user_id`, `session_id`, `metadata`) as early as possible in your instrumentation so they propagate to all downstream spans automatically.
</Callout>

### What's changing in the SDKs

The new SDKs streamline the data model by focusing on observations:

| Attribute | Status | Migration Path |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| `name` | Deprecated | Use root span name (generated automatically) |
| `release` | Deprecated | Use `version` instead |
| `input`/`output` | Deprecated | Set on the relevant observation/span |
| `tags` | Deprecated | Use `metadata` or scores |
| `version` | ✅ **Supported** | Continues as span-level attribute |
| `metadata` | ✅ **Supported** | Propagates across all spans |
| `user_id` | ✅ **Supported** | Propagates across all spans |
| `session_id` | ✅ **Supported** | Propagates across all spans |
| `public` | ✅ **Supported** | Set at observation level |

Don't worry—we're maintaining backwards compatibility. Old SDK versions continue to work, though you'll get the best performance with the latest versions.

## Rollout timeline

We're rolling out the new infrastructure gradually:

1. ✅ **Available now**: New SDKs with attribute propagation
2. 🚀 **Coming soon**: Core tracing UI migrated to observation-first views
3. 📊 **Next**: Dashboards and LLM-as-a-judge updates
4. 🔌 **Future**: Public APIs v2 with observation-only endpoints

Users on older SDK versions will continue to work with backwards compatibility, though you may experience a ~3 minute ingestion delay during the transition period. Upgrading to the latest SDK removes this delay and unlocks the full performance benefits.

## Feature updates

**Core Tracing UI**: Redesigned around observations. Better filtering and navigation, especially for complex agentic traces.

**Dashboards**: Enhanced performance with the new data model. Charts using deprecated trace attributes will get migration guides.

**LLM-as-a-judge**: Moving to observation-level evaluations for much faster execution. Trace-level evals remain backwards compatible.

**Public APIs**: New v2 endpoints deliver 10-100x faster responses. Existing APIs remain available during migration.

**Exports**: Performance improvements across UI exports, blob storage, and Posthog integrations.

<ChangelogHeader />

AI agents do real work in terminals, writing code, debugging, querying APIs. As part of our effort to [make agents fall in love with Langfuse](/blog/2026-02-13-will-you-be-my-cli), we built a CLI that wraps the entire Langfuse API so agents (and humans) can interact with Langfuse directly.

```bash
npx langfuse-cli api <resource> <action>
```

The CLI covers all functionality exposed via our APIs, you can get traces, observations, update prompts or create datasets and more.

## Discovery & Usage

Progressive disclosure built in — start broad, drill down:

```bash
langfuse api help                     # List all resources
langfuse api prompts --help           # List actions for prompts
langfuse api prompts create --help    # Show flags for create

langfuse api traces list --limit 10
langfuse api prompts get --name my-prompt
langfuse api traces list --limit 5 --curl  # Preview curl without executing
```

26 resources supported: traces, prompts, datasets, scores, metrics, annotation queues, and more.

## Authentication

Pass an `--env .env` file to load your API key from a file. Alternatively, export the relvant variables:

```bash
export LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-...
export LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...
export LANGFUSE_HOST=https://cloud.langfuse.com  # default, supports self-hosted
```

## Pairs with Agent Skills

The CLI is designed to work together with our [Agent Skills](https://github.com/langfuse/skills). The main Langfuse skill teaches agents how to discover endpoints, follow common workflows, and access documentation — all through the CLI. Read more about Skills and the full agent story in [the blog post](/blog/2026-02-13-will-you-be-my-cli).

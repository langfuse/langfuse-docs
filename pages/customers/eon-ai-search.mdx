[E.ON](https://www.eon.de/de/pk.html), one of Europe's largest energy companies serving millions of consumers and companies alike, transformed their traditional website search into a sophisticated AI-powered customer interaction channel building on Langfuse.

Today millions of customers and partners have access to the project helping them answer critical questions about their energy consumption. [Try it here!](https://www.eon.de/de/aisearch.html)

The project serves as a logical first step in E.ON's broader AI strategy.

## Starting with Prompt Management for Fast Iteration

What started as a POC quickly became more complex: FAQ checking, hybrid search, re-ranking, document grading, and answer generation. With that iterating prompts and debugging became a nightmare.

Here is how E.ON adopted Langfuse through different project stages:

## Confidently launching with Evals & Deployment Pipelines

### Evals

Moving from proof-of-concept to production required abandoning "gut feeling as quality assurance". E.ON has implemented a complementary set of evaluations to ship with confidence. This gives them **24/7 visibility into quality** and **makes releasing prompt or code changes to users much less scary**.

They are especially excited about the [G-Eval methodology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16634) and having it run on the Langfuse platform.

Here is their recipe:

<CustomerQuote
  quote="Langfuse's evals are a game changer. We can run experiments against datasets more or less with one line of code or with just pushing a button. The team now confidently makes changes knowing they can measure impact across the entire system."

### Deployment Pipeline

The team runs a sophisticated workflow for experiment driven development (EDD) using Langfuse's [prompt labeling](https://langfuse.com/docs/prompts/get-started#labels):

</Frame>

1. Develop prompts in development environments  
2. Run [evaluations against datasets](https://langfuse.com/docs/datasets/overview)    
3. Test in staging  
4. Deploy to production with rollback capabilities  

Prompt iterations became much faster than code deployments

## Optimizing Latency & Time-to-first-token

The team discovered that time-to-first-token mattered more than overall latency since users remain engaged once output starts streaming.

Using Langfuse Timelines, they ran a very structured set of ROI analysis on many components.

What has helped E.ON to **reduce latency to first token by 70%**:

1. **Parallelizing** steps that ran in sequence (e.g. grading of documents)  
2. **Simplifying** by throwing out most design patterns that added latency without improving quality

<CustomerQuote
  quote="There is so much content out there about fancy architectures and I think we tried them all. Langfuse's Latency Tracking made us aware that most of the fancy stuff only increased latency and did nothing for quality. What worked for us was to simplify over and over again."

## What's next

E.ON views their search as a customer interaction channel that will expand to include agentic workflows for logged-in users, enabling real transactions and personal data access.

With Langfuse providing the foundational infrastructure, E.ON confidently scales their AI capabilities while maintaining enterprise reliability for millions of customers.

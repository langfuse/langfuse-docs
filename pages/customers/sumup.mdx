## About SumUp
[SumUp](https://www.sumup.com/en-gb/) is a leading global fintech company trusted by over 4 million merchants in more than 35+ markets worldwide. It stands out by making card payments easy and accessible for small businesses, offering simple, reliable hardware and software solutions within a comprehensive multipillar ecosystem of financial solutions.

## The Challenge
The mission was simple: empower SumUp's merchant support teams with an AI assistant as the first entry point for all customer support requests. The challenge was far from trivial. 

**Multi-market complexity and scale:** SumUp's merchant support serves over 4 million merchants across 35+ markets with market-specific differences in requirements. 

**Security & Privacy:** SumUp operates in Financial Services, data privacy and security are of paramount importance and had to be maintained throughout the project. 

**Systems Integration:** Conversations within SumUp's customers are complex and require follow-ups and clarifications, as well as querying a variety of systems. The implementation had to model highly complex LLM interactions and tool uses.

## Solution: multiple layers of AI empowerment

**Merchant facing with hybrid support model:** AI assistant that answers first line of questions & routes the conversation to humans if necessary.

**Internal:** Self-built AI Translation tools allow support agents to help merchants in languages other than their own & AI Agent Copilot that helps agents find most relevant resources, drafting answers and reducing handling time. 

## Rollout

SumUp handled their market rollout strategically and incrementally. Here is how SumUp rolled out AI-Powered Support to 35+ markets within 18 months successfully.

**Expansion Strategy**
* Begin with English-speaking markets (Ireland and UK)  
* Focus on smaller volume merchants first  
* Slowly increase volume while monitoring reliability metrics  
* Expanded based on improved performance versus previous solution.  
* Extend to markets with no previous existing Bot support

## How SumUp is using Langfuse

In early PoC stages of the project, SumUp got started quickly with using Langfuse [Self-Hosting](/self-hosting) – no tedious vendor onboarding & evaluation before having a better understanding of project requirements and needs. Once the system got closer to production and full rollout, the team happily switched over to let Langfuse Cloud do the grunt work of making the systems run reliably.

Tracing was the clear starting point of implementation. Yet, during the project the team has set up elaborate multi-team workflows powered by Langfuse to enable continuous development & monitoring of 25 users across Engineering, Support Operations, Content, Q\&A and other stakeholders.

**Tracing: Deep Visibility Across Teams:** 

Langfuse [Observability & Tracing](/docs/observability/overview) gives SumUp a unified view on all LLM inputs, tool uses and outputs across functions. Engineers can run very detailed asynchronous debugging. Content owners understand shortcomings of LLM inputs & context documents. Q&A has full visibility in output quality.

**Prompt Management & Playground: Fast Iteration & Empowering Non-Technical Staff**

[Prompt management](/docs/prompt-management/overview) lets business teams and engineers alike iterate and test prompt changes in production really fast. The system is integrated with a self-built set of evaluators to test new iterations automatically. [The Playground](/docs/prompt-management/features/playground) lets SumUp reproduce exact production configs, variables and tool integrations from production traces into a simple UI to quickly iterate on prompt improvements before implementing them. Reproducing the exact production environment was very time consuming for engineers and impossible for non-technical staff before using Langfuse.

## Business Impact

<CustomerQuote
  quote="Building on Langfuse we have achieved a 50% deflection rate of conversations that don't go to humans. That is 300,000 monthly merchant requests that no longer require human support – that’s 10,000 per day! Even though merchant numbers grow fast; we can focus our resources on more valuable challenges."

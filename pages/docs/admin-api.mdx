# Admin API

<Callout type="warning">

  The admin API requires an organization-scoped API key pair.
  Those are restricted to self-hosted instances at this time and will become available on Langfuse Cloud soon.

</Callout>

Langfuse is open and meant to be extended via custom workflows and integrations.
You can use these endpoints to automate project and user management on your Langfuse organization.

References:

- API Reference: https://api.reference.langfuse.com
- OpenAPI spec: https://cloud.langfuse.com/generated/api/openapi.yml

All applicable endpoints are marked with `(requires organization-scoped API key)`.
Those include the following routes.

- `POST /api/public/projects`
- `DELETE /api/public/projects/{projectId}`
- `PUT /api/public/organizations/memberships`
- `GET /api/public/organizations/memberships`
- `PUT /api/public/projects/{projectId}/memberships`
- `DELETE /api/public/projects/{projectId}/memberships`

In addition, we implement the following [SCIM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7642) compliant endpoints.
Use `/api/public/scim` as the base URI for them.

- `GET /ServiceProviderConfig`
- `GET /ResourceTypes`
- `GET /Schemas`
- `GET /Users`
- `POST /Users`
- `GET /Users/{id}`
- `DELETE /Users/{id}`

## Authentication

Authenticate with the API using [Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
Organization scoped API keys can be created via the [Organization Management API](/self-hosting/organization-management-api).
In the future, they will be available within the Organization Settings page within Langfuse.

Example:

```bash
curl -u public-key:secret-key https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/projects
```

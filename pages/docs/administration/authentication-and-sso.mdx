# Authentication & SSO

By default, Langfuse supports email/password and social logins (Sign in with Google, GitHub, Microsoft).

For increased security, you can also configure Enterprise SSO (e.g. Okta, OneLogin, Azure AD, Keycloak etc.) via OIDC.

For more details on authorization, please refer to the [RBAC docs](/docs/administration/rbac).

For self-hosted instances, please refer to the [Self-hosted Authentication and SSO guide](/self-hosting/security/authentication-and-sso).

## Email/Password authentication

By default, Langfuse uses email and password authentication. Langfuse enforces standard password complexity requirements.

If you signed up with a social login, you can add a password via the "reset password" link in the login page.

## Social Logins

For simplified access, users can sign in using their existing social accounts:

- Google
- GitHub
- Azure AD (Entra ID)

For security reasons, Langfuse does not support switching between social logins or signing up with a social login after signing up with email/password.

## Enterprise SSO & SSO Enforcement [#sso]

Langfuse supports **Enterprise SSO** (e.g. Okta, OneLogin, Azure AD, Keycloak etc.) via OIDC. Please reach out to [support](/support) to enable this feature.

Details:

- **Migration:** Existing users who signed up with an email/password or social logins are automatically migrated to the Enterprise SSO provider once it is set up.
- **Authorization:** Enterprise SSO does not automatically provision [roles](/docs/administration/rbac) for new users upon signup. Users must be invited to an organization, either through the UI (settings > members) or the [SCIM API](/docs/administration/scim-and-org-api).
- **Signing in:** To sign in with an Enterprise SSO provider, please (1) enter your email address, and (2) press "Continue". You will be redirected to the Enterprise SSO provider to authenticate.

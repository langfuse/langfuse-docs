# Billable Units

Langfuse Cloud [pricing](/pricing) is based on the number of ingested units per billing period. Units are either [traces](/docs/observability/data-model#traces), [observations](/docs/observability/data-model#observations) or [scores](/docs/evaluation/evaluation-methods/data-model#scores).

`Units` = `Count of Traces` + `Count of Observations` + `Count of Scores`

Use our [pricing calculator](/pricing?calculatorOpen=true) to estimate your monthly costs based on your expected usage.

# Data Deletion

There may be use-cases where you want to remove selected data from Langfuse, like erroneously created traces in a development flow, user data for PII, or your whole project.
In case you want to retain only recent data, you can use our [Data Retention](/docs/data-retention) feature.

You can delete unwanted data from Langfuse by:

- Deleting a single trace;
- Deleting a batch of traces;
- Deleting all traces that match a query filter;
- Deleting a project;
- Deleting an organization; or
- Deleting a user account.

Below, we will walk through each of the options and their guarantees.

## Deleting Traces

Note that all trace deletions will delete related entities like scores and observations across all data storages.

### Single Trace

<Tabs items={["UI", "API"]}>

<Tab>

To delete a single trace, open its detail view and hit the `Delete` button.
Confirm that you want to delete the given trace.

<Frame className="my-10" fullWidth>
  ![Delete a single trace](/images/docs/delete-single-trace.png)
</Frame>

</Tab>

<Tab>

```
DELETE /api/public/traces/{traceId}​
```

See [reference](https://api.reference.langfuse.com/#tag/trace/DELETE/api/public/traces/%7BtraceId%7D).

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Batch of Traces

<Tabs items={["UI", "API"]}>

<Tab>

To delete a batch of traces, select them in the trace list and select `Delete` in the `Actions` dropdown.

<Frame className="my-10" fullWidth>
  ![Delete a batch of traces](/images/docs/delete-trace-batch.png)
</Frame>

</Tab>

<Tab>

```
DELETE /api/public/traces
```

See [reference](https://api.reference.langfuse.com/#tag/trace/DELETE/api/public/traces).

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Delete by Query

<Tabs items={["UI"]}>

<Tab>

To delete all traces that match a query filter, configure your desired filter in the traces list.
Select all items on the current page and change that to all items in the top bar.
Then select `Delete` in the `Actions` dropdown.

<Frame className="my-10" fullWidth>

</Frame>

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Limitations

Most deletions in Langfuse happen instantly, but the deletion of tracing data does not.
Removing those records from our data warehouse is a resource intensive operation and, therefore, we rate limit
how many deletions we process at any point in time.
Usually, trace data is deleted from our system within 15 minutes of the delete call and there is no confirmation, i.e.
in order to verify that your data got deleted, you will have to query it again.

## Deleting a Project

<Tabs items={["UI"]}>

<Tab>

To delete a project, navigate to the project settings and scroll to the `Danger Zone` within the `General` section.
Confirm that you want to delete your project.
This action immediately revokes all API keys and schedules the project for deletion.
Within the next minutes, all related data is irreversibly removed from our system.

<Callout type="warning">
  Deleting a project is irreversible and all data will be removed. Be cautious
  when executing this action.
</Callout>

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Deleting an Organization

<Tabs items={["UI"]}>

<Tab>

If there are no projects left in an organization, you can delete the organization in the organization settings.
Navigate to the organization settings and scroll to the `Danger Zone` within the `General` section.
Confirm that you want to delete your organization.
The organization and all associated user information will be removed from our system.

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Deleting a User Account (Cloud)

To delete your user account, please message us at support@langfuse.com.

## Deleting a User Account (Self-Host)

Remove the corresponding user record from the `users` table and drop all foreign keys to it using cascade.

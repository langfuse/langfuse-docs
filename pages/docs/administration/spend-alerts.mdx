Configure spend alerts to receive email notifications when your organization's spending exceeds a predefined monetary threshold. This helps you monitor costs and take action before unexpected charges occur.

Navigate to your organization settings and the **Billing** tab to configure spend alerts.

## How it works

Spend alerts monitor your organization's total spending on Langfuse Cloud. You can set custom thresholds in your organization's billing currency and receive email notifications when spending crosses these limits.

**Threshold calculation:** Spend is evaluated against the total expected invoice, including base fees, usage-based fees, discounts, and taxes.

**Monitoring frequency:** We check each organization's usage every 60-90 minutes to ensure timely notifications.

**Notifications:** Email alerts are sent to all organization members with **Owner** or **Admin** roles. Each configured alert triggers at most once per billing cycle to avoid notification fatigue.

# Troubleshooting

This section provides solutions to common issues you may encounter while administering Langfuse, including authentication, SSO setup, user management, and other administrative tasks.

## Authentication & SSO Issues

### SSO Login Failures

If users are experiencing issues with Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication:

1. **Verify SSO Configuration**
   - Check that your identity provider (IdP) configuration matches the Langfuse SSO settings
   - Ensure all required fields are properly configured
   - Verify that the SSO domain mapping is correct

2. **Check User Permissions**
   - Confirm that users have the appropriate permissions in your IdP
   - Verify that user attributes are being passed correctly
   - Check RBAC settings if applicable

3. **Network Connectivity**
   - Ensure that Langfuse can reach your identity provider
   - Check for firewall or proxy issues that might block SSO requests
   - Verify SSL certificates are valid and trusted

4. **Generate HAR File for Support**
   - If the issue persists, generate a HAR file to help with troubleshooting
   - See our [HAR File Export Guide](/docs/administration/troubleshooting/har-export) for detailed instructions

### Authentication Token Issues

**Problem**: Users receive "Invalid token" or "Token expired" errors

**Solutions**:
- Check if the system clock is synchronized across all services
- Verify JWT token expiration settings
- Ensure proper token refresh mechanisms are in place

## User Management Issues

### Users Not Appearing in Organization

**Problem**: Invited users don't appear in the organization or can't access resources

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the user accepted the invitation email
2. Check that the user is logging in with the correct email address
3. Ensure the user has the appropriate role assignments
4. Check organization membership settings

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Issues

**Problem**: Users can't access expected features or see certain data

**Solutions**:
1. Review the user's assigned roles and permissions
2. Check if custom roles are configured correctly
3. Verify that resource-level permissions are properly set
4. Ensure role inheritance is working as expected

## Data and Performance Issues

### Slow Dashboard Loading

**Problem**: Dashboards and metrics take a long time to load

**Solutions**:
1. Check if you're within your plan's usage limits
2. Review data retention settings and consider archiving old data
3. Optimize queries by using appropriate date ranges and filters
4. Contact support if performance issues persist

### Missing Data or Metrics

**Problem**: Expected traces, metrics, or observations are not appearing

**Solutions**:
1. Verify that your applications are properly instrumented
2. Check API key configuration and permissions
3. Review sampling settings that might be filtering data
4. Ensure proper project and environment configuration

## API and Integration Issues

### API Rate Limiting

**Problem**: Receiving rate limit errors when using the Langfuse API

**Solutions**:
1. Review your current API usage against plan limits
2. Implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff
3. Consider batching requests where possible
4. Upgrade your plan if you need higher rate limits

### Webhook Failures

**Problem**: Webhooks are not being delivered or are failing

**Solutions**:
1. Verify webhook endpoint URL is accessible
2. Check that the endpoint returns proper HTTP status codes
3. Ensure webhook payload format is handled correctly
4. Review webhook logs for error details

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I reset a user's password?

Users can reset their own passwords using the "Forgot Password" link on the login page. As an administrator, you cannot directly reset user passwords for security reasons.

### Can I migrate data between organizations?

Data migration between organizations requires careful planning. Contact support for assistance with data migration procedures.

### How do I delete an organization?

Organization deletion is a permanent action that cannot be undone. Contact support to initiate organization deletion with proper data backup procedures.

### Why can't I see certain projects or traces?

This is typically due to RBAC permissions. Check your role assignments and ensure you have access to the specific projects or environments you're trying to view.

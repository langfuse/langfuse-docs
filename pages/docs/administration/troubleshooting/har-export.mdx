# HAR File Export Guide

When troubleshooting SSO (Single Sign-On) or authentication issues, support teams often need detailed information about network requests and responses. A HAR (HTTP Archive) file captures this information, providing valuable insights into what happens during the authentication process.

## What is a HAR File?

A HAR file is a JSON-formatted archive that logs all HTTP requests made by your browser during a specific timeframe. It includes:

- Request and response headers
- Cookies and session data
- Timing information
- Response content
- Error details

This information helps identify issues like failed API calls, incorrect redirects, missing headers, or network timeouts.

## When to Generate a HAR File

Generate a HAR file when experiencing:

- SSO login failures or redirects not working
- Authentication tokens not being properly exchanged
- Unexpected errors during the login process
- Slow or hanging authentication requests
- Cookie or session-related issues

## Browser-Specific Instructions

### Google Chrome

1. **Open Developer Tools**
   - Navigate to the Langfuse page where you're experiencing issues
   - Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
   - Or right-click on the page and select "Inspect"

2. **Access the Network Tab**
   - Click on the "Network" tab in the Developer Tools panel
   - If you don't see the Network tab, click the `>>` button to expand more tabs

3. **Configure Recording Settings**
   - Ensure the red record button (üî¥) is active (it should be red)
   - Check the "Preserve log" checkbox to keep logs during page navigation
   - Optionally, check "Disable cache" to ensure fresh requests

4. **Clear Existing Logs** (recommended)
   - Click the clear button (üö´) to remove any existing network logs

5. **Reproduce the Issue**
   - Refresh the page or navigate to trigger the SSO process
   - Perform the exact steps that lead to the authentication issue
   - Wait for all network requests to complete

6. **Export the HAR File**
   - Right-click anywhere in the network log area
   - Select "Save all as HAR with content"
   - Choose a location and filename to save the HAR file

   - Choose "Export HAR" from the dropdown
   - Save the file to your computer

## Security and Privacy Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: HAR files contain sensitive information including:

- Authentication tokens and session cookies
- API keys and passwords (if transmitted)
- Personal data in request/response bodies
- Internal URLs and system information

### Before Sharing a HAR File:

1. **Review the Contents**
   - Open the HAR file in a text editor to check for sensitive data
   - Look for authentication tokens, passwords, or personal information

2. **Redact Sensitive Information**
   - Remove or replace sensitive values with placeholders like `[REDACTED]`
   - Pay special attention to Authorization headers and cookie values

3. **Use Secure Channels**
   - Only share HAR files through secure, encrypted channels
   - Consider using password-protected archives for additional security

4. **Delete After Use**
   - Remove the HAR file from your computer once the issue is resolved
   - Ask the recipient to delete their copy as well

## What to Include When Submitting

When sending a HAR file to support, also include:

- **Detailed Description**: Explain what you were trying to do when the error occurred
- **Expected vs. Actual Behavior**: What should have happened vs. what actually happened  
- **Browser Information**: Browser type and version
- **Timestamp**: When the issue occurred
- **User Account**: Which user account experienced the issue (if applicable)
- **Environment**: Which Langfuse environment (production, staging, etc.)

## Troubleshooting HAR Export Issues

### No Network Requests Visible

- Ensure the record button is active before reproducing the issue
- Check that you're on the correct tab when the requests are made
- Try refreshing the page with Developer Tools open

### HAR File Too Large

- Clear browser cache and cookies before recording
- Focus on reproducing just the specific issue
- Use shorter time windows for recording

### Missing Authentication Requests

- Ensure "Preserve log" is enabled before starting the authentication flow
- Don't close or refresh Developer Tools during the process
- Start recording before clicking any login buttons

## Alternative Tools

If browser Developer Tools aren't suitable, consider these alternatives:

- **Fiddler**: Comprehensive HTTP debugging proxy
- **Charles Proxy**: HTTP proxy for monitoring network traffic
- **Postman**: For testing API endpoints directly
- **curl**: Command-line tool for making HTTP requests

These tools can provide similar network debugging capabilities and may be more suitable for certain scenarios.

## Next Steps

After generating and reviewing your HAR file:

1. Follow the security guidelines above to protect sensitive information
2. Include the HAR file with your support request along with the additional context mentioned
3. Be prepared to provide additional information if requested by the support team

<Callout type="warning">
Usage alerts are temporarily disabled on Langfuse Cloud as we have noticed an unexpected behaviour from our payment provider around usage alerting.
Existing alerts will _not_ be triggered and new alerts cannot be configured.
Alerts will reset once we have deployed a fix.
We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
</Callout>

Langfuse Cloud allows you to configure usage alerts to receive email notifications when the number of events in your organization exceeds a predefined threshold.
This helps you monitor your usage and take action before you are invoiced.
Navigate to your organization settings and the **Billing** tab to configure usage alerts.

Usage alerts only consider usage that was added after the alert was configured or last updated.
The alerts trigger at most once per billing cycle.

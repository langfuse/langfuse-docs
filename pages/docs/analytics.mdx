Langfuse analytics derives actionable insights from production data.

## Metrics

- **Quality** is measured through user feedback, model-based scoring and human-in-the-loop scored samples (see [scores](/docs/scores)). Quality is assessed over time as well as across prompt versions, LLMs and users.
- **Cost and Latency** are accurately measured and broken down by user, session, geography, feature, model and prompt version.

## Insights

- **Monitor quality/cost/latency tradeoffs** by version to facilitate product and engineering decisions
- Break down **LLM usage by customer** for usage-based billing and profitability analysis

## Sharing and Collaboration

Dashboards are shared across your project, allowing team members to:

- View the same dashboard with real-time data
- Create specialized dashboards for different teams or use cases
- Reference dashboards in discussions and documentation

## Roadmap

In addition to the existing Beta scope, we plan to add:

- **Langfuse-managed templates**: Predefined templates for common use cases that can be cloned and customized.
- **Custom home dashboard**: A personalized dashboard that serves as the default view for the project when you log in.
- **Query API**: An API that exposes our dashboard query language to allow for custom queries and data retrieval.

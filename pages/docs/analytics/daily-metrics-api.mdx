# Daily Metrics API

<Callout type="warning">

This API is a legacy API. For new use cases, please use the [Metrics API](/docs/analytics/metrics-api) instead.

</Callout>

```
GET /api/public/metrics/daily
```

Via the **Daily Metrics API**, you can retrieve aggregated daily usage and cost metrics from Langfuse for downstream use, e.g., in analytics, billing, and rate-limiting. The API allows you to filter by application type, user, or tags for tailored data retrieval.

See [API reference](https://api.reference.langfuse.com/#tag/metrics/GET/api/public/metrics/daily) for more details.

## Overview

Returned data includes daily timeseries of:

- [Cost](/docs/model-usage-and-cost) in USD
- Trace and observation count
- Break down by model name
  - Usage (e.g. tokens) broken down by input and output usage
  - [Cost](/docs/model-usage-and-cost) in USD
  - Trace and observation count

Optional filters:

- `traceName` to commonly filter by the application type, depending on how you use `name` in your traces
- `userId` to filter by [user](/docs/tracing-features/users)
- `tags` to filter by [tags](/docs/tracing-features/tags)
- `fromTimestamp`
- `toTimestamp`

```
GET /api/public/metrics/daily?traceName=my-copilot&userId=john&limit=2

# PostHog Integration (Beta)

import { CloudflareVideo } from "@/components/Video";

[PostHog](https://posthog.com) is a popular choice for OSS product analytics. While Langfuse offers [analytics](/docs/analytics) out of the box, many of our users have asked for a way to **integrate their LLM related metrics that they capture with Langfuse into their PostHog dashboards**.

We've built an integration to make it easy to answer questions like:

- _"Are my most active users also the ones who are most engaged with my LLM content?"_
- _"Does interacting with the LLM feature relate to higher retention rates?"_
- _"How does the LLM feature impact my conversion rates?"_
- _"Does the user feedback that I capture in Langfuse correlate with the user behavior that I see in PostHog?"_

## Example PostHog Dashboard

<CloudflareVideo
  videoId="d27b3b672f9091495c05444df12b23cf"
  aspectRatio={16 / 9.33}
  gifStyle
/>

## Get started

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This is a beta feature and currently only available for users of our managed
  service.
</Callout>

## Build a dashboard in PostHog

Once integrated, you can build a dashboard in PostHog to visualize your Langfuse metrics. Use the _AI Metrics_ template to get started with a pre-built dashboard that includes the most common metrics from Langfuse.

## Integration details

On a daily schedule Langfuse batches aggregated events and metrics to your PostHog instance.

### Metadata matching

Matching of metadata helps to join the data from Langfuse with the data from PostHog:

| Langfuse                                                      | PostHog        | Notes                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user_id`                                                     | `$distinct_id` |                                                                           |
| `trace.timestamp`, `generation.started_at`, `score.timestamp` | `timestamp`    |                                                                           |
| `trace.metadata.$posthog_session_id`                          | `$session_id`  | Optional, you need to add the PostHog session id to your Langfuse traces. |

### User properties

We send the following user properties via `'$set'`:

- `langfuse_user_url`: Deeplink to the [user profile](/docs/tracing/users) in Langfuse.

### Events

You can decide which events you want to send to PostHog. By default, we send all of the following events:

#### Event: `langfuse trace`

- `timestamp`: The time the event occurred.
- `langfuse_trace_name`: The name of the trace.
- `langfuse_url`: The URL of the trace.
- `langfuse_id`: The unique identification of the trace.
- `langfuse_cost_usd`: The total cost associated with the trace.
- `langfuse_count_observations`: The number of observations in the trace.
- `langfuse_session_id`: The session ID related to the event.
- `langfuse_project_id`: An ID associated with the project related to the event.
- `langfuse_user_id`: User ID related to the event. If it's null, it's marked as langfuse_unknown_user.
- `langfuse_latency`: The latency of the event.
- `langfuse_release`: Information relating to the event release.
- `langfuse_version`: The version of the event.
- `langfuse_tags`: Any tags associated with the event.
- `langfuse_integration_version`: The integration version of LangFuse.

#### Event: `langfuse generation`

- `timestamp`: The start time of the generation.
- `langfuse_generation_name`: The name of the generation.
- `langfuse_trace_name`: Name of the trace related to the generation.
- `langfuse_url`: The URL of the generation on the host platform.
- `langfuse_id`: Unique identifier of the generation.
- `langfuse_cost_usd`: Computed total cost of the generation.
- `langfuse_input_units`: Number of tokens utilized in prompting the generation.
- `langfuse_output_units`: Number of tokens produced by the generation.
- `langfuse_total_units`: Total number of tokens consumed in the generation process.
- `langfuse_unit`: The units used for the generation (likely tokens).
- `langfuse_session_id`: The session ID associated with the trace of the generation.
- `langfuse_project_id`: The project identification where the generation happened.
- `langfuse_user_id`: The user ID that started the trace linked to the generation. In case it's unavailable, it defaults to `langfuse_unknown_user`.
- `langfuse_latency`: The observed latency of the generation.
- `langfuse_release`: Release information of the trace attached with the generation.
- `langfuse_version`: The versioning info about the generation.
- `langfuse_model`: The model used during this generation's process.
- `langfuse_level`: The level associated with the generation.
- `langfuse_tags`: Any tags attached to the trace of the generation.
- `langfuse_integration_version`: The integration version with LangFuse.

#### Event `langfuse score`

- `timestamp`: The time when the score event occurred.
- `langfuse_score_name`: The name associated with the score.
- `langfuse_score_value`: The value of the score.
- `langfuse_score_comment`: Any comments attached with the score.
- `langfuse_trace_name`: The name of the trace associated with the score.
- `langfuse_id`: The unique identification of the score.
- `langfuse_session_id`: The session identification related to the score's trace.
- `langfuse_project_id`: The project identification linked with the score's trace.
- `langfuse_user_id`: The user ID that triggered the trace tied with the score. If not available, defaults to `langfuse_unknown_user`.
- `langfuse_release`: The release information of the trace associated with the score.
- `langfuse_tags`: Any tags related to the trace of the score.
- `langfuse_integration_version`: The integration version with LangFuse.

# Langfuse CLI

The Langfuse CLI wraps the entire [Langfuse API](/docs/api-and-data-platform/features/public-api) so you can interact with Langfuse directly from the terminal. It is built for AI coding agents and power users who prefer the command line.

Read the full documentation in the dedicated [CLI GitHub Repo](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-cli).


Get started by running:

```bash
npx langfuse-cli api <resource> <action>
```

Or just ask your coding agent to do it for you:

```markdown
please install langfuse-cli
```

## What it can do

The CLI can do anything the [Langfuse API](/docs/api-and-data-platform/features/public-api) can do. 

It dynamically wraps the full OpenAPI spec, so every endpoint (traces, prompts, datasets, scores, sessions, metrics, and more) is available as a CLI command. See the full [API Reference](https://api.reference.langfuse.com) for details.

## Why use it

- **Let your coding agent manage Langfuse for you.** Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, etc. can use the CLI to create datasets, pull traces, update prompts, and more without you leaving the editor.
- **Script your workflows.** Automate repetitive tasks like exporting traces, batch-scoring, or syncing prompts across environments in CI/CD or bash scripts.
- **Faster than the UI for quick lookups.** Grab the last 5 traces, check a prompt version, or list scores in seconds.

## Pairs with Agent Skills

The CLI is designed to work together with [Agent Skills](https://github.com/langfuse/skills). The main Langfuse skill teaches agents how to discover endpoints, follow common workflows, and access documentation, all through the CLI.

You can create schedule exports to a Blob Storage, e.g. S3, GCS, or Azure Blob Storage, for `traces`, `observations`, and `scores`.

Those exports can run on an `hourly`, `daily`, or `weekly` schedule.
Navigate to your project settings and select `Integrations > Blob Storage` to set up a new export.
Select whether you want to use S3, a S3 compatible storage, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage.

## Start exporting via Blob Storage

To set up the export navigate to `Your Project` > `Settings` > `Integrations` > `Blob Storage`.

Fill in the settings to authenticate with your vendor, enable the integration, and press save.
Within an hour an initial export should start and continue based on the schedule you have selected.
The export supports CSV, JSON, and JSONL file formats.
Read [our blob storage documentation](/self-hosting/deployment/infrastructure/blobstorage) for more information on how to get credentials for your specific vendor.

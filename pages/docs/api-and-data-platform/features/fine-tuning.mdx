## Export Data for Fine-Tuning

To export generations and training data for fine-tuning, see the comprehensive [Export Data](/docs/api-and-data-platform/overview) guide which includes:

- Export generations in OpenAI JSONL format for fine-tuning
- Filter by quality scores to export high-performing examples
- Multiple export formats (CSV, JSON, JSONL)
- Programmatic access via SDKs and APIs

## SDKs/API

All data collected in Langfuse is also available programmatically via the API and SDKs (Python, JS/TS). Refer to the [API reference](https://api.reference.langfuse.com/) and [Export Data](/docs/api-and-data-platform/overview) for more information.

# Observations API

The Observations API allows you to retrieve observation data (spans, generations, events) from Langfuse for use in custom workflows, evaluation pipelines, and analytics.

## Observations API v2 (Beta) [#v2]

<Callout type="warning">

The v2 Observations API is currently in **beta**. The API is stable for production use, but some parameters and behaviors may change based on user feedback before general availability.

**Data availability note:** When using current SDK versions, data may take approximately 5 minutes to appear on v2 endpoints. We will be releasing updated SDK versions soon that will make data available immediately.

</Callout>

```
GET /api/public/v2/observations
```

The v2 Observations API is a redesigned endpoint optimized for high-performance data retrieval. It addresses the performance bottlenecks of the v1 API by minimizing the work Langfuse has to perform per query.

### Key Improvements

**1. Selective Field Retrieval**

The v1 API returns complete rows with all fields (input/output, usage, metadata, etc.), forcing the database to scan every column even when you only need a subset. The v2 API lets you specify which field groups you need as a comma-separated string:

```
?fields=core,basic,usage
```

#### Available Field Groups

| Group      | Fields                                                                                  |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `core`     | Always included: id, traceId, startTime, endTime, projectId, parentObservationId, type  |
| `basic`    | name, level, statusMessage, version, environment, bookmarked, public, userId, sessionId |
| `time`     | completionStartTime, createdAt, updatedAt                                               |
| `io`       | input, output                                                                           |
| `metadata` | metadata                                                                                |
| `model`    | providedModelName, internalModelId, modelParameters                                     |
| `usage`    | usageDetails, costDetails, totalCost, providedUsageDetails, providedCostDetails         |
| `prompt`   | promptId, promptName, promptVersion                                                     |
| `metrics`  | latency, timeToFirstToken                                                               |

If `fields` is not specified, `core` and `basic` field groups are returned by default.

**2. Cursor-Based Pagination**

The v1 API uses offset-based pagination (page numbers) which becomes increasingly slow for large datasets. The v2 API uses cursor-based pagination for better and more consistent performance.

**How it works:**

1. Make your initial request with a `limit` parameter
2. If more results exist, the response includes a `cursor` in the `meta` object
3. Pass this cursor via the `cursor` parameter in your next request to continue where you left off
4. Repeat until no cursor is returned (you've reached the end)

Results are always sorted by `startTime` descending (newest first).

**Example response with cursor:**

```json
{
  "data": [
    {"id": "obs-1", "traceId": "trace-1", "name": "llm-call", ...},
    {"id": "obs-2", "traceId": "trace-1", "name": "embedding", ...}
  ],
  "meta": {
    "cursor": "eyJsYXN0U3RhcnRUaW1lIjoiMjAyNS0xMi0xNVQxMDozMDowMFoiLCJsYXN0SWQiOiJvYnMtMTAwIn0="
  }
}
```

When the response has no `cursor` in `meta` (or `meta.cursor` is `null`), you've retrieved all matching observations.

**3. Optimized I/O Handling**

The v1 API always attempts to parse input/output as JSON which can be expensive. The v2 API returns I/O as strings by default. Set `parseIoAsJson: true` only when you need parsed JSON.

**4. Stricter Limits**

| Feature       | v1        | v2    |
| ------------- | --------- | ----- |
| Default limit | 1000      | 50    |
| Maximum limit | Unlimited | 1,000 |

### Common Use Cases

**Polling for recent observations:**

```bash
curl \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <BASIC AUTH HEADER>" \
  "https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/v2/observations?fromStartTime=2025-12-15T00:00:00Z&toStartTime=2025-12-16T00:00:00Z&limit=10"
```

**Getting observations for a specific trace:**

```bash
curl \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <BASIC AUTH HEADER>" \
  "https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/v2/observations?fields=core,basic,usage&traceId=your-trace-id"
```

**Paginating through results:**

```bash
# First request
curl \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <BASIC AUTH HEADER>" \
  "https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/v2/observations?fromStartTime=2025-12-01T00:00:00Z&limit=100"

# Response includes: "meta": { "cursor": "eyJsYXN0..." }

# Next request with cursor
curl \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <BASIC AUTH HEADER>" \
  "https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/v2/observations?fromStartTime=2025-12-01T00:00:00Z&limit=100&cursor=eyJsYXN0..."
```

## Observations API v1 [#v1]

```
GET /api/public/observations
```

The v1 Observations API remains available for existing integrations. For new implementations, we recommend using the v2 API for better performance.

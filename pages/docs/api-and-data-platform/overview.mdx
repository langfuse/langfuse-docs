# API & Data Platform

**Langfuse is designed to be open, extensible and flexible** (see [_why langfuse?_](/why)). People using Langfuse are building all kinds of workflows and customizations on top of it. This is powered by our open data platform.

Example use cases:

- Billing based on LLM costs tracked in Langfuse
- Reporting of online evaluations in external dashboards
- Fine-tuning based on raw exports of traces
- Correlation of LLM Evals with observed user behavior in Data Warehouse

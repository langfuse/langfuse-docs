Langfuse's audit logging system provides comprehensive tracking of all system activities, capturing detailed information about who performed what actions, when they occurred, and what changes were made.
This feature is essential for enterprise security, compliance requirements, and incident investigation.

## What are Audit Logs?

Audit logs are immutable records of all significant activities within your Langfuse organization and projects.
They capture:

- **Who**: User or API key that performed the action
- **What**: The specific action taken (create, update, delete)
- **When**: Precise timestamp of the action
- **Where**: Organization and project context
- **Details**: Complete before/after state for modifications

These logs provide a complete audit trail for security monitoring, compliance reporting, and forensic analysis.

## Auditable Resources

Langfuse tracks specific actions across all system resources.
The following table shows the exact resource types and actions that are logged:

| Resource                     | Actions                                               |

## Event Types and Data Capture

### State Capture
For update operations, Langfuse captures:
- **Before State**: Complete resource state prior to modification
- **After State**: Complete resource state after modification

States are stored as JSON, providing full context for any modifications made to your data.

## User Attribution

### Identity Sources

Audit logs distinguish between different types of actors:

- **User Actions** (`USER` type): Actions performed by authenticated users through the web interface
- **API Key Actions** (`API_KEY` type): Programmatic actions via API keys

### Context Information

Each entry includes:
- **User ID**: For user-initiated actions
- **API Key ID**: For programmatic actions
- **Organization ID**: Organizational context
- **Role Context**: User's organizational and project roles at the time of action

## Viewing Audit Logs

The audit log viewer is available in the Enterprise Edition and provides:

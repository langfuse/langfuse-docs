# Feature Overview

Langfuse consists of tooling for LLM Application tracing, evaluation, and prompt engineering.
See [general overview](/docs) to learn more about them.

## Tracing

Instrument your app and start ingesting [traces](/docs/tracing) to Langfuse, thereby tracking LLM calls and other relevant logic in your app such as retrieval, embedding, or agent actions. Inspect and debug complex logs and user sessions.

## Prompt Management

[Langfuse Prompt Management](/docs/prompts) helps you centrally manage, version control, and collaboratively iterate on your prompts.

import PromptOverview from "@/components-mdx/prompt-overview-gifs.mdx";

The [LLM Playground](/docs/playground) is a tool for testing and iterating on your prompts and model configurations, shortening the feedback loop and accelerating development.

## Evaluations

[Evaluations](/docs/scores) are the most important part of the LLM Application development workflow. Langfuse adapts to your needs and supports LLM-as-a-judge, user feedback, manual labeling, and custom evaluations.

## Datasets

Via [Langfuse Datasets](/docs/datasets) you can create test sets and benchmarks to evaluate the performance of your LLM application in development.

## Comments

[Comments](/docs/comments) enable collaborative debugging and knowledge sharing by allowing team members to add contextual notes directly to traces, observations, sessions, and prompts. This feature supports markdown formatting and integrates seamlessly into your workflow.

# Custom Dashboards

Transform your LLM application data into actionable insights with Langfuse custom dashboards.
Create personalized views that track the metrics that matter most to your team - from latency and cost optimization to quality monitoring and user behavior analysis.

Custom dashboards provide a flexible, self-service analytics solution built on a powerful query engine that supports multi-level aggregations across your [tracing data](/docs/tracing-data-model).
Whether you're monitoring production performance, analyzing user feedback trends, or correlating costs with quality metrics, dashboards give you the visualization tools to make data-driven decisions.

- **Multi-Level Aggregations**: Aggregate data at trace, user, or session levels to answer complex analytical questions
- **Real-Time Updates**: Dashboards reflect live data from your LLM applications
- **Team Collaboration**: Share dashboards across your project for unified monitoring and insights
- **Langfuse Curated Dashboards**: A set of pre-built dashboards focused on Latency, Cost, and Langfuse usage to quickly get started

## Quick Start

Get started with custom dashboards in two simple steps or use Langfuse's curated dashboards right away.

<Steps>

### Create Your First Widget

Widgets are individual visualization components that display specific metrics from your LLM application data.

1. Navigate to the **Dashboards** section in your Langfuse project
2. Select the **Widgets** tab
3. Click **New Widget**
4. Configure your widget:
   - **Data Source**: Choose from traces, observations, or evaluation scores
   - **Metrics**: Select what to measure (count, latency, cost, scores, etc.)
   - **Dimensions**: Group by user, model, time, trace name, etc.
   - **Filters**: Narrow down to specific data subsets
   - **Chart Type**: Pick the best visualization for your data
5. Click **Save** to store your widget

### Build Your Dashboard

Combine multiple widgets into comprehensive dashboards that tell the story of your LLM application performance.

1. Navigate to the **Dashboards** tab
2. Click **New Dashboard**
3. Give your dashboard a descriptive name (e.g., "Production Monitoring", "Cost Analysis", "Quality Metrics")
4. Add widgets by selecting from your existing widgets or creating new ones
5. Arrange widgets using the drag-and-drop interface
6. Resize widgets to emphasize important metrics

</Steps>

### Leverage Curated Dashboards

Jump-start your analytics with Langfuse-curated dashboards that focus on common LLM application monitoring needs:

- **Latency Dashboard**: Monitor response times across models and user segments
- **Cost Dashboard**: Track token usage and associated costs over time
- **Usage Dashboard**: Understand your Langfuse platform utilization

These pre-built dashboards can be used as-is or cloned and customized to match your specific requirements.

## Advanced Features

### Advanced Filtering and Grouping

Create precise data views using Langfuse's powerful filtering capabilities:

- **Metadata Filters**: Filter by custom metadata attached to traces and observations
- **Time-Based Filters**: Analyze specific time periods or compare time ranges
- **User Properties**: Segment by user characteristics and behavior patterns
- **Model Parameters**: Filter by specific model configurations or versions
- **Tags and Labels**: Use [trace tags](/docs/tracing-features/tags) for categorical filtering
- **Score Thresholds**: Filter by quality score ranges or feedback ratings

### Chart Types and Visualization

Choose the right visualization for your data:

- **Line Charts**: Perfect for tracking trends over time (latency, cost, usage)
- **Bar Charts**: Compare values across categories (models, users, features)
- **Time Series**: Monitor real-time metrics with temporal granularity
- **Pie Charts**: Display proportions of categorical data (e.g., feedback ratings)

### Dynamic Layout and Responsiveness

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Easily rearrange widgets to create logical groupings
- **Responsive Design**: Dashboards adapt to different screen sizes and devices
- **Widget Resizing**: Emphasize important metrics with larger visualizations
- **Grid System**: Maintain clean, organized layouts automatically

### Data Export and Integration

Export your dashboard data for further analysis or integration with external tools. See the [Export Data](/docs/data-analytics/features/export) guide for comprehensive export options including:

- CSV export of dashboard data
- Integration with external analytics tools
- Programmatic access via the [Metrics API](/docs/data-analytics/features/metrics-api)

## Use Cases and Examples

### Production Monitoring Dashboard

Monitor the health and performance of your LLM application in real-time:

- **Error Rate Tracking**: Monitor failed requests and error patterns
- **Latency Analysis**: Track P95 and P99 response times across different endpoints
- **Throughput Monitoring**: Visualize request volume and capacity utilization
- **Model Performance**: Compare accuracy and quality metrics across model versions
- **Tool Usage & Latency**: Track how often each external tool (e.g. API calls, database queries) is invoked and its latency

### Cost Optimization Dashboard

Understand and optimize your LLM usage costs:

- **Token Usage Trends**: Track input/output token consumption over time
- **Cost per User**: Identify high-usage users and optimize pricing strategies
- **Model Cost Comparison**: Compare costs across different LLM providers and models
- **Feature Cost Analysis**: Understand which application features drive the highest costs

### Quality and User Experience Dashboard

Monitor the quality and user satisfaction of your LLM application:

- **User Feedback Trends**: Track thumbs up/down ratings and detailed feedback
- **Score Distribution**: Visualize the distribution of quality scores over time
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Understand how users interact with different features
- **A/B Test Results**: Compare quality metrics between different model versions or prompts

With Langfuse's Data Retention feature, you can control how long your event data (Traces, Observations, Scores, and Media Assets) is stored in Langfuse.
Data retention is configured on a project level, and we accept a number of days with a minimum of 7 days.
Project owners and administrators can change the data retention setting within the Project Settings view.

## Details

On a nightly basis, Langfuse selects traces, observations, scores, and media assets that are older than the configured retention period and deletes them.
We use the following properties per entity to decide whether they are outside the retention window:

- **Traces**: `timestamp`
- **Observations**: `start_time`
- **Scores**: `timestamp`
- **Media Assets**: `created_at`

Deleted assets cannot be recovered.

## Self-hosted Instances

To use the Data Retention feature in a self-hosted environment, you need to grant `s3:DeleteObject` to the Langfuse IAM role on all buckets (see [Blob Storage (S3) docs](/self-hosting/infrastructure/blobstorage)).
Note that Langfuse only issues delete statements on the API.
If you use versioned buckets, delete markers and non-current versions need to be removed manually or with a lifecycle rule.

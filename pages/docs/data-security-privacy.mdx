## Security Measures

### Langfuse Cloud

- We encrypt all data at rest and in transit using TLS.
- Our database and application run on AWS infrastructure, partly managed by Supabase and Vercel.
  - US data region (https://us.cloud.langfuse.com): Oregon (AWS us-west-2)
  - EU data region (https://cloud.langfuse.com): Ireland (AWS eu-west-1)
- We use Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) with database backups and Write Ahead Log.
- All users have access to SSO (Single Sign-On) through OAuth 2.0 with Google, GitHub, and Azure. We can enforce SSO for your organization (Team plan and above) to require 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) and configure any custom SSO provider.
- We do not use any of your data for model training and treat it confidentially ([terms and conditions](/terms)).

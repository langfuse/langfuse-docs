## Security Measures

**Langfuse Cloud**

- We encrypt all data at rest and in transit using TLS.
- Our database and application run on AWS infrastructure, managed by Supabase and Vercel.
  - Default data regions:
    - US, Northern California (AWS us-west-1), https://us.cloud.langfuse.com
    - Europe, Frankfurt, Germany (AWS eu-central-1), https://cloud.langfuse.com

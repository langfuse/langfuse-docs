# Data Privacy and Security

At Langfuse, we prioritize data privacy and security. We understand that the data you entrust to us is a vital asset to your business, and we treat it with the utmost care.

## Security Measures

**Langfuse Cloud**

- We encrypt all data at rest and in transit using TLS.
- Our database and application run on AWS infrastructure, managed by Supabase and Vercel.
  - Default data regions:
    | Langfuse Region | Domain | Data location |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Europe | cloud.langfuse.com | Frankfurt, Germany (AWS eu-central-1) |
    | US | us.cloud.langfuse.com | Northern California, US (AWS us-west-1) |
  - We offer other regions and dedicated deployments for enterprise customers.
- We use Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) with database backups and Write Ahead Log.
- All users have access to SSO (Single Sign-On) through OAuth 2.0 with Google and GitHub. We can enforce SSO for your organization (Team plan and above) to require 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication).

Our team is dedicated to improving our parsers, aiming to deliver a parsing quality that surpasses that of any open-source solution, particularly for documents with complex structures and tables. We are currently focusing our efforts on enhancing the parsing capabilities for `.docx` (Microsoft Word) and Adobe `.pdf` files, given their widespread use.

For optimal results, we recommend using the `.docx` format.

### Special Focus on Tables

Recognizing the importance of tables in documentation, especially for our enterprise customers, we understand that most existing chatbot solutions struggle with accurate table parsing. The AssistMe platform places a special emphasis on table parsing, ensuring the highest quality responses for queries related to data within tables. Our commitment is to provide reliable and precise information retrieval from structured data, enhancing the user experience.

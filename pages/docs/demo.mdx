### Reporting

- Monitor usage (cost control)
- Track latency, quality (based on user feedback) and OpenAI errors

### Tracing

Each response is based on the following steps which can go wrong, be slow or expensive:

1. Embedding of user request
2. Embedding similarity search in Postgres
3. Summary of docs as markdown
4. Generation of response based on retrieved context and chat history

This is how a single trace looks like in Langfuse:

### User feedback collection

In this example, we can see how we do:

1. Collection of feedback using the Langfuse Web SDK
   > _Negative, Langchain not included in response_
2. Browsing of feedback
3. Identification of the root cause of the low-quality response
   > Docs on Langchain integration are not included in embedding similarity search

# Interactive Langfuse Demo

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { ToAppButton } from "@/components/ToAppButton";

The Langfuse demo is a **live, shared project** that lets you explore Langfuse's features with real data before setting up your own account. Think of it as a hands-on walkthrough where you can see how teams use Langfuse for LLM observability, prompt management, and evaluation.

The demo provides **view-only access**.

## Getting Started with the Demo

### Step 1: Access the Demo Project

Create a free account (no credit card required) to access the demo project.

<div className="mt-3">
  <ToAppButton
    signedInText="View Demo project"
    signUpText="Create Demo account"
    dropdownText="View Demo project"
  />
</div>

### Step 2: Understand What You're Seeing

When you first open the demo project, you'll land on the **Traces** page. Here's what you're looking at:

- Each row represents one interaction with the demo chatbot
- You'll see traces from all users (not just yours). This is intentional so you can explore diverse examples
- The traces show: timing, costs, input/output, and any scores assigned by evaluations

**Try this:**
1. Click on any trace to see detailed execution steps
2. Notice the graph view showing how the chatbot's components work together
3. Look for traces with scores to see how evaluation works

**Explore all features:** Browse the left navigation to explore [Tracing](/docs/tracing), [Sessions](/docs/tracing/sessions), [Prompts](/docs/prompts), [Scores](/docs/scores), and [Datasets](/docs/datasets). Each area shows how Langfuse works in a complete LLM application.

## Interact with the Demo Chatbot

The chatbot below generates all the traces you see in the demo project. Every question creates a new trace that you can inspect in Langfuse.

import { Chat } from "@/components/qaChatbot";

<Chat className="mt-6" />

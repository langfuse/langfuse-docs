## Open demo project in Langfuse

Access the demo project by creating a free account (no credit card required). Select the EU instance since the demo is not currently available on the US instance.

<Button asChild className="mt-3" variant="cta">
  <a
    href="https://cloud.langfuse.com/project/clkpwwm0m000gmm094odg11gi"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
  >
    Create demo account (EU data region)
  </a>
</Button>

## Produce new traces & scores

Interact with the new AI demo at [/docs/ai-demo](/docs/ai-demo) to see streaming responses and tool usage.



<div className="p-2 rounded mt-8 bg-gradient-to-tr from-green-300 via-blue-500 to-purple-600">
  {/* Legacy Chat removed. See new demo: /docs/ai-demo */}
</div>

# Interactive Demo

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

Try Langfuse yourself with a view-only project.

<Steps>

### View demo project in Langfuse

Access the demo project by creating a free account (no credit card required). Select the EU instance since the demo is not currently available on the US instance.

<Button asChild className="mt-3" variant="cta">
  <a
    href="https://cloud.langfuse.com/auth/sign-up"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
  >
    Create demo account (EU data region)
  </a>
</Button>

### Produce new traces & feedback

Interact with chatbot below to see new traces and user feedback (👍/👎) in Langfuse.

import { Chat } from "@/components/qaChatbot";

<div className="p-2 rounded mt-8 bg-gradient-to-tr from-green-300 via-blue-500 to-purple-600">
  <Chat className="h-[40rem] my-0 bg-background/90" />
</div>

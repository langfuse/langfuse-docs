# Self-hosted deployment - Docker Compose

This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy Langfuse on a cloud provider using Docker Compose.
You will need access to a cloud provider like AWS, GCP, or Azure to deploy the application with permissions to deploy a virtual machine.

## Start a new instance

Enter your cloud provider interface and navigate to the VM instance section.
This is EC2 on AWS, Compute Engine on GCP, and Virtual Machines on Azure.
Create a new instance.
We recommend that you use at least 4 cores and 16 GiB of memory, e.g. a t3.xlarge on AWS.
Assign a public IP address in case you want to send traces from external sources.

The rest of this guide will assume that you have an Ubuntu OS running on your VM.

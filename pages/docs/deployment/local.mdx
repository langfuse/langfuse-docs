# Local Machine

This setup is the easiest to get started with. It will start a local database and the Langfuse server. The server is exposed on port `3000` by default.

It is **not recommended to use this setup in production** as the database is not persisted and environment variables are not secret. Check out [Langfuse Cloud](/docs/deployment/cloud) for a production-ready setup maintained by the Langfuse team or alternatively [self-host](/docs/deployment/self-host).

Requirements: `docker` and `docker compose`, both included in [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if you are on Mac or Windows.

## Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git
cd langfuse

# Run server and db
docker compose up
```

-> Visit http://localhost:3000

## Upgrade

Docker has a rich caching functionalities built in. If you want to fetch the latest container, make sure to `docker-compose pull
` as shown below. Otherwise, it will use the cached version of the Langfuse container.

```bash
# navigate to the Langfuse directory
cd langfuse

# Stop server and db
docker compose down

# Pull latest changes
git pull
docker-compose pull

# Run server and db
docker compose up
```

## Development setup

It will start a local database via Docker and the Langfuse server via NPM. The development server will watch for changes and restart automatically.

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git
cd langfuse

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the db in the background
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# create an env file
cp .env.dev.example .env

# Apply database migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Optional: seed the database
# npm run db:seed
# npm run db:seed:examples

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

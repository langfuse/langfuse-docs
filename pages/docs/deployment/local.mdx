# Local Machine

## Requirements

- `docker` and `docker compose`, both included in [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Docker compose

This setup is the easiest to get started with. It will start a local database and the Langfuse server. The server is exposed on port `3030` by default.

It is not recommended to use this setup in production as the database is not persisted. Checkout [Langfuse Cloud](/docs/deployment/cloud) for a production-ready setup maintained by the Langfuse team or alternatively [self-host](/docs/deployment/self-host).

```bash
# clone Langfuse from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git

# switch into Langfuse directory
cd langfuse

# start Langfuse
docker-compose up
```

Afterwards, use the Langfuse [API](/docs/integrations/api) or client [SDKs](/docs/integrations/sdk) to interact with the server, and view the application ui at http://localhost:3030

## Local development

This setup is for local development. It will start a local database via Docker and the Langfuse server via NPM. The server will be restarted on file changes.

```bash
# clone Langfuse from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git

# switch into Langfuse directory
cd langfuse

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the db
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# create an env file
cp .env.dev.example .env

# Migration
npx prisma migrate dev

# Seed the database
npx prisma db seed

# Start the server
npm run dev
```

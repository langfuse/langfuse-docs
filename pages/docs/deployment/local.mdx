# Local Deployment - Open Source LLM Observability

<Callout type="warning">
  This setup is **not suitable for production use** as the database is not
  persistent and environment variables are not kept secret. For a
  production-ready setup, follow the [self-hosting
  guide](/docs/deployment/self-host) or consider using [Langfuse
  Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com) maintained by the Langfuse team.
</Callout>

You can run Langfuse on your local machine using docker compose. This method is ideal for testing Langfuse and troubleshooting integration issues.

Requirements: `docker` and `docker compose`, both are included in [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
for Mac or Windows users.

## Getting Started

<Steps>

### Start the Langfuse Server

```bash
# Clone the Langfuse repository
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git
cd langfuse

# Checkout V2 branch
git checkout v2

# Start the database and langfuse server
docker compose up
```

Langfuse is now running on your local machine:

- The server is accessible at: `http://localhost:3000`
- Integrations: set the `HOST`/`BASEURL` of the SDKs to `http://localhost:3000`

Langfuse is very configurable, see [self-hosting (docker) guide](/docs/deployment/self-host) for more details on configuration options.
Checkout the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/v2/docker-compose.yml) file for more details.

### Create an Account

Create a new account at `http://localhost:3000/auth/sign-up`.

### Follow the Quickstart Guide

Follow the [quickstart guide](/docs/get-started) to get up and running with Langfuse Tracing or explore the rest of the [documentation](/docs).

</Steps>

## Updating Langfuse

Docker has robust caching functionalities. To fetch the latest Langfuse container, you need to run `docker compose pull langfuse-server`. Otherwise, Docker will use the cached version of the Langfuse container.

```bash
# Navigate to the Langfuse directory
cd langfuse

# Stop the server and database
docker compose down

# Pull the latest changes to the docker compose file
git pull

# Pull the latest Langfuse container
docker compose pull langfuse-server

# Restart the server and database
docker compose up
```

## Setting Up a Development Environment

Refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions on how to set up a development environment.

## Troubleshooting

The [self-hosting guide](/docs/deployment/self-host) is more extensive and includes troubleshooting steps which are also applicable to local deployments using docker compose.

# Self-Hosting Instructions

[![Docker Image](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-langfuse-blue?logo=Docker&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/pkgs/container/langfuse)

The Langfuse Server (includes API and Web UI) is open source and can be self-hosted using Docker.

## Docker

<Steps>

### Postgres database

You need to have a permanent Postgres database to persist the state of Langfuse. You can use a managed service on AWS, Azure, or GCP, or you can run it yourself. After setting it up, copy the _connection string_.

### Deploy the container

Deploy the container to your infrastructure. You can use a managed service like AWS ECS, Azure Container Instances, or GCP Cloud Run, or you can run it yourself.

During the startup of the container, all database migrations will be applied automatically.

Environment variables:

- Set `DATABASE_URL` to the connection string of your Postgres database.
- Set `NEXTAUTH_URL` to the URL of your deployment, e.g. `https://yourdomain.com` or `http://localhost:3000`.
- Secrets, generate them with at least 512 entropy using `openssl rand -base64 32`
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` to secure the session JWTs.
  - `SALT` is used to salt the API key hashes.

Optionally:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SIGN_UP_DISABLED=true` blocks new sign ups.
- `PORT` sets the port the server listens on (default: 3000).
- `HOSTNAME` defaults to `localhost`. In some environments it needs to be set to `0.0.0.0` to be accessible from outside the container (e.g. Google Cloud Run).
- Enable signing into Langfuse using OAuth providers. For detailed instructions, see [NextAuth.js docs](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/google).
  - Google: `AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - GitHub: `AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`

```bash
docker run --name langfuse \
-e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname> \
-e NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
-e NEXTAUTH_SECRET=mysecret \
-e SALT=mysalt \
-p 3000:3000 \
-a STDOUT \
ghcr.io/langfuse/langfuse:latest
```

</Steps>

## Update Docker

<Steps>

### Pull latest changes

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/langfuse/langfuse:latest
```

### Run container

```bash
docker run --name langfuse \
-e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname> \
-e NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
-e NEXTAUTH_SECRET=mysecret \
-e SALT=mysalt \
-p 3000:3000 \
-a STDOUT \
ghcr.io/langfuse/langfuse:latest
```

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, please make sure that you've done the following:

- `NEXTAUTH_URL` exactly matches the url you're accessing Langfuse with. Pay attention to the protocol (http vs https) and the port (e.g. 3000 if you do not expose Langfuse on port 80).
- Set `HOSTNAME` to `0.0.0.0` in case you cannot access Langfuse.
- SSO: Make sure that the OAuth provider is configured correctly. The return path needs to match the `NEXTAUTH_URL` and the OAuth client needs to be configured with the correct callback URL.

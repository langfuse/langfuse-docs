# Self-Hosting Instructions

[![Docker Image](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-langfuse-blue?logo=Docker&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/pkgs/container/langfuse)

The Langfuse Server (includes API and Web UI) is open source and can be self-hosted using Docker.

For a full component and architecture diagram, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Requirement: Postgres Database

To persist the state of Langfuse, a permanent Postgres database is required. You have the option to use a managed service on AWS, Azure, or GCP, or run it yourself. Once the database is set up, make sure to copy the connection string.

## Running the Application

To run the application container, deploy it to your infrastructure. You have the option to use managed services such as AWS ECS, Azure Container Instances, or GCP Cloud Run, or you can choose to run it on your own.

During the container startup, all database migrations will be applied automatically.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/langfuse/langfuse:latest
```

```bash
docker run --name langfuse \
-e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname> \
-e NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
-e NEXTAUTH_SECRET=mysecret \
-e SALT=mysalt \
-p 3000:3000 \
-a STDOUT \
ghcr.io/langfuse/langfuse:latest
```

You can also one-click deploy on Railway:

## Environment variables

Langfuse is configurable using environment variables. Some are required as defined in the following table:

| Variable                            | Required / Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`                      | Required           | Connection string of your Postgres database. Instead of `DATABASE_URL`, you can also use `DATABASE_HOST`, `DATABASE_USERNAME`, `DATABASE_PASSWORD` and `DATABASE_NAME`.            |
| `DIRECT_URL`                        | `DATABASE_URL`     | Connection string of your Postgres database used for database migrations. Use this if you want to use a different user for migrations or use connection pooling on `DATABASE_URL`. |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL`                      | Required           | URL of your deployment, e.g. `https://yourdomain.com` or `http://localhost:3000`. Required for successful authentication via OAUTH.                                                |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`                   | Required           | Used to validate login session cookies, generate secret with at least 512 entropy using `openssl rand -base64 32`.                                                                 |
| `SALT`                              | Required           | Used to salt hashed API keys, generate secret with at least 512 entropy using `openssl rand -base64 32`.                                                                           |
| `PORT`                              | `3000`             | Port the server listens on.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `HOSTNAME`                          | `localhost`        | In some environments it needs to be set to `0.0.0.0` to be accessible from outside the container (e.g. Google Cloud Run).                                                          |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SIGN_UP_DISABLED`      | `false`            | Set to `true` to block all new sign ups. Only existing users can sign in.                                                                                                          |
| `AUTH_DOMAINS_WITH_SSO_ENFORCEMENT` |                    | comma-separated list of domains that are only allowed to sign in using SSO. Email/password sign in is disabled for these domains. E.g. `domain1.com,domain2.com`                   |
| `AUTH_DISABLE_USERNAME_PASSWORD`    | `false`            | Set to `true` to disable email/password sign for all users. Only OAuth/SSO providers can be used to sign in.                                                                       |
| `LANGFUSE_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID`       |                    | Configure optional default project for new users. When users create an account they will be automatically added to this project.                                                   |
| `LANGFUSE_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ROLE`     | `VIEWER`           | Role of the user in the default project (if set). Possible values are `ADMIN`, `MEMBER`, `VIEWER`. See [project roles](/docs/project-sharing) for details.                         |

Optional: Enable **OAuth/SSO** provider sign-in for Langfuse. Refer to the [NextAuth.js docs](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/google) for detailed instructions.

## Upgrading the Application

Langfuse is released through tagged semver releases. Check out [GitHub releases](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/releases) for information about the changes in each version.

To upgrade the application:

1. Stop the container.
2. Pull the latest container.
3. Start the application again.

During container startup, any necessary database migrations will be applied automatically if the database schema has changed.

It is recommended to enable automated upgrades to benefit from the latest features, bug fixes and security patches.

## Health Check Endpoint

Langfuse includes a health check endpoint at `/api/public/health`. This endpoint checks both API functionality and database connectivity.

Access the health check endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/public/health
```

The potential responses from the health check endpoint are:

- `200 OK`: Both the API is functioning normally and a successful connection to the database was made.
- `503 Service Unavailable`: Either the API is not functioning or it couldn't establish a connection to the database.

Applications and monitoring services can call this endpoint periodically for health updates.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, please make sure that you've done the following:

- `NEXTAUTH_URL` exactly matches the url you're accessing Langfuse with. Pay attention to the protocol (http vs https) and the port (e.g. 3000 if you do not expose Langfuse on port 80).
- Set `HOSTNAME` to `0.0.0.0` in case you cannot access Langfuse.
- SSO: Make sure that the OAuth provider is configured correctly. The return path needs to match the `NEXTAUTH_URL` and the OAuth client needs to be configured with the correct callback URL.
- Encode special characters in `DATABASE_URL`, see this StackOverflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68213745) for details.
- If you use the SDKs to connect with Langfuse, use `auth_check()` to verify that the connection works.

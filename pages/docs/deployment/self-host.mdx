# Self-Hosting Guide

[![Docker Image](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-langfuse-blue?logo=Docker&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/pkgs/container/langfuse)

Langfuse Server, which includes the API and Web UI, is open-source and can be self-hosted using Docker.

For a detailed component and architecture diagram, refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Prerequisites: Postgres Database

Langfuse requires a persistent Postgres database to store its state. You can use a managed service on AWS, Azure, or GCP, or host it yourself. Once the database is ready, keep the connection string handy.

## Deploying the Application

Deploy the application container to your infrastructure. You can use managed services like AWS ECS, Azure Container Instances, or GCP Cloud Run, or host it yourself.

During the container startup, all database migrations will be applied automatically.

We follow _semantic versioning_ for Langfuse releases, i.e. breaking changes are only introduced in a new major version.

- We recommend [automated updates](#update) within a major version to benefit from the latest features, bug fixes, and security patches.
- Subscribe to our mailing list to get notified about new releases and new major versions.

### Configuring Environment Variables

Langfuse can be configured using environment variables ([.env.prod.example](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/main/.env.prod.example)). Some are mandatory as defined in the table below:

| Variable                                                                                             | Required / Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Instead of `DATABASE_URL`, you can also use `DATABASE_HOST`, `DATABASE_USERNAME`, `DATABASE_PASSWORD` and `DATABASE_NAME`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Use this if you want to use a different user for migrations or use connection pooling on `DATABASE_URL`. **For large deployments**, configure the database user with long timeouts as migrations might need a while to complete.                                                                                            |

This is often the case if you use a Cloud database. Refer to the [Prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/understanding-prisma-migrate/shadow-database#cloud-hosted-shadow-databases-must-be-created-manually) for detailed instructions. |

### Authentication

#### SSO

To enable OAuth/SSO provider sign-in for Langfuse, add the following environment variables:

| Provider                                               | Variables                                                                                                                                        | OAuth Redirect URL            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| [Google](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/google)    | `AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`<br/>`AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`<br/>`AUTH_GOOGLE_ALLOW_ACCOUNT_LINKING=true` (optional)                                  | `/api/auth/callback/google`   |
| [GitHub](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/github)    | `AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`<br/>`AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`<br/>`AUTH_GITHUB_ALLOW_ACCOUNT_LINKING=true` (optional)                                  | `/api/auth/callback/github`   |
| [AzureAD](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/azure-ad) | `AUTH_AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID`<br/>`AUTH_AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET`<br/>`AUTH_AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID`<br/>`AUTH_AZURE_ALLOW_ACCOUNT_LINKING=true` (optional) | `/api/auth/callback/azure-ad` |
| [Okta](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/okta)        | `AUTH_OKTA_CLIENT_ID`<br/>`AUTH_OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET`<br/>`AUTH_OKTA_ISSUER`<br/>`AUTH_OKTA_ALLOW_ACCOUNT_LINKING=true` (optional)                 | `/api/auth/callback/okta`     |
| [Auth0](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/auth0)      | `AUTH_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`<br/>`AUTH_AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`<br/>`AUTH_AUTH0_ISSUER`<br/>`AUTH_AUTH0_ALLOW_ACCOUNT_LINKING=true` (optional)             | `/api/auth/callback/auth0`    |

Use `*_ALLOW_ACCOUNT_LINKING` to allow merging accounts with the same email address. This is useful when users sign in with different providers or email/password but have the same email address. You need to be careful with this setting as it can lead to security issues if the emails are not verified.

Need another provider? Langfuse uses Auth.js, which integrates with [many providers](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/). Add a [feature request on GitHub](/ideas) if you want us to add support for a specific provider.

| Variable                            | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AUTH_DOMAINS_WITH_SSO_ENFORCEMENT` | comma-separated list of domains that are only allowed to sign in using SSO. Email/password sign in is disabled for these domains. E.g. `domain1.com,domain2.com` |
| `AUTH_DISABLE_USERNAME_PASSWORD`    | Set to `true` to disable email/password sign for all users. Only OAuth/SSO providers can be used to sign in.                                                     |
| `AUTH_DISABLE_SIGNUP`               | Set to `true` to disable sign up for new users. Only existing users can sign in.                                                                                 |

### Health Check Endpoint

Langfuse includes a health check endpoint at `/api/public/health`. This endpoint checks both API functionality and database connectivity.

Access the health check endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/public/health
```

The potential responses from the health check endpoint are:

- `200 OK`: Both the API is functioning normally and a successful connection to the database was made.
- `503 Service Unavailable`: Either the API is not functioning or it couldn't establish a connection to the database.

Applications and monitoring services can call this endpoint periodically for health updates.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, ensure the following:

- `NEXTAUTH_URL` exactly matches the URL you're accessing Langfuse with. Pay attention to the protocol (http vs https) and the port (e.g., 3000 if you do not expose Langfuse on port 80).
- Set `HOSTNAME` to `0.0.0.0` if you cannot access Langfuse.
- SSO: Ensure that the OAuth provider is configured correctly. The return path needs to match the `NEXTAUTH_URL`, and the OAuth client needs to be configured with the correct callback URL.
- Encode special characters in `DATABASE_URL`, see this StackOverflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68213745) for details.
- If you use the SDKs to connect with Langfuse, use `auth_check()` to verify that the connection works.

### How to update

To update the application:

1. Stop the container.
2. Pull the latest container.
3. Restart the application.

During container startup, any necessary database migrations will be applied automatically if the database schema has changed.

We recommend enabling automated updates to benefit from the latest features, bug fixes, and security patches.

### Apply newly supported models to existing data in Langfuse [#migrate-models]

Langfuse includes a list of supported models for [usage and cost tracking](/docs/model-usage-and-cost). If a Langfuse update includes support for new models, these will only be applied to newly ingested traces/generations.

Optionally, you can apply the new model definitions to existing data using the following steps. During the migration, the database remains available (non-blocking).

1. Clone the repository and create an `.env` file:

   ```bash
   # Clone the Langfuse repository
   git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git

   # Navigate to the Langfuse directory
   cd langfuse

   # Install all dependencies
   pnpm i

   # Create an .env file
   cp .env.dev.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` to connect to your database from your machine:

   ```bash filename=".env"
   NODE_ENV=production

   # Replace with your database connection string
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
   ```

3. Execute the migration. Depending on the size of your database, this might take a while.

   ```bash
   pnpm run models:migrate
   ```

4. Clean up: remove the `.env` file to avoid connecting to the production database from your local machine.

### Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run & Cloud SQL)

The simplest way to deploy Langfuse on Google Cloud Platform is to use Cloud Run for the containerized application and Cloud SQL for the database.

**Create Cloud SQL Instance:**

1. Open Google Cloud SQL.
2. Click on Create Instance.
3. Choose PostgreSQL and configure the instance according to your requirements.
4. You'll need the following details:
   - default > user: postgres
   - default > database schema: public
   - setup > password: `<password>`
   - connection > connection name: `<google-cloud-project-id>:<region-id>:<sql-instance-id>`

**Deploy on Cloud Run:**

1.  Open Google Cloud Run.
2.  Click on Create Service.
3.  Enter the following container image URL: `docker.io/langfuse/langfuse:2`. We use tag `2` to pin the major version.
4.  Configure the service name and region according to your requirements.
5.  Select authentication as 'Allow unauthenticated invocations', as Langfuse will have its own built-in Authentication that you can use.
6.  Choose 'CPU Allocation and Pricing' as "CPU is only allocated during request processing" to scale down the instance to 0 when there are no requests.
7.  Configure ingress control according to your needs. For most cases, 'All' should suffice.
8.  "Container(s), Volumes, Networking & Security":

    - Specify container port as `3000`.
    - On "Variables & Secrets" tab, add the required environment variables (see table above): `SALT`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, and `DATABASE_URL`, etc.
      - To configure Cloud SQL, add the following:
        - `DATABASE_URL` as the connection string to the Cloud SQL instance. `postgresql://<user-name>:<password>@localhost/<db-name>/?host=/cloudsql/<google-cloud-project-id>:<region-id>:<sql-instance-id>&sslmode=none&pgbouncer=true`
        - `DIRECT_URL` for database migrations, without `&pgbouncer=true`, the value should look like this: `postgresql://<user-name>:<password>@localhost/<db-name>/?host=/cloudsql/<google-cloud-project-id>:<region-id>:<sql-instance-id>&sslmode=none`
      - Set `NEXTAUTH_URL` to `http://localhost:3000`. This is a placeholder, we'll update it later.

9.  Scroll all the way down to enable the Cloud SQL connections. Select the created Cloud SQL instance in the dropdown. Context: Your Cloud Run service won't be assigned a static IP, so you can't whitelist the ingress IP in Cloud SQL or any other hosted databases. Instead, we use the Google Cloud SQL Proxy.
10. Finally, you can finish deploying the application.
11. While the application is deployed for the first time, you can see how the database migrations are applied in the logs.
12. Once the application is up and running, you can find the Cloud Run service URL on top of the page. Now, choose "Edit and deploy new revision" to update the `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable to the Cloud Run service URL ending in `.run.app`.
13. Optionally, configure a custom domain for the Cloud Run service.

**Use Cloud Build to deploy**

Google Cloud Build is GCP's continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) service that automates the building, testing, and deployment of your applications. To deploy the Langfuse LLM analytics project, you can specify your workflow in a cloudbuild.yaml file. Additionally, GCP's Secret Manager can be used to securely handle sensitive information like DATABASE_URL and NEXTAUTH_SECRET. Below is an example of how to set up a Cloud Build configuration:

```yaml
# Deployment configuration for Langfuse on Google Cloud Run
substitutions:
  _SERVICE_NAME: langfuse
  _REGION: europe-west1
  _PROJECT_ID: your-project-id  # Change to your Google Cloud project ID

tags: ['${_PROJECT_ID}', '${_SERVICE_NAME}']

steps:
  # Step to deploy the Docker image to Google Cloud Run
  - name: "gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud"
    id: deploy-cloud-run
    entrypoint: bash
    args:
      - "-c"
      - |
        gcloud beta run deploy ${_SERVICE_NAME} --image docker.io/langfuse/langfuse:2 \
           --region ${_REGION} \
           --project ${_PROJECT_ID} \
           --platform managed \
           --allow-unauthenticated \
           --memory 2Gi \
           --cpu 1 \
           --min-instances 0 \
           --max-instances 3 \
           --set-env-vars HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 \
           --update-secrets AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID:latest, \
                            AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET:latest, \
                            SALT=SALT:latest, \
                            NEXTAUTH_URL=LANGFUSE_URL:latest, \
                            NEXTAUTH_SECRET=NEXTAUTH_SECRET:latest, \
                            DATABASE_URL=DATABASE_URL:latest, \
                            DIRECT_URL=DIRECT_URL:latest

```

You can submit this build using [`gcloud build submit`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/builds/submit) in your local console by issuing the below in the same folder as the `cloudbuild.yaml` file.

To submit this build, use the following command in your local console, in the directory containing the `cloudbuild.yaml` file:

```
gcloud builds submit .
```

For automatic rebuilds upon new commits, set up a [Cloud Build Trigger](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/automating-builds/create-manage-triggers) linked to your repository holding the `cloudbuild.yaml` file. This will redeploy Langfuse LLM analytics whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

**AlloyDB**

[AlloyDB](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb) is a fully-managed postgres compatible database offered by Google Cloud Platform that is tuned for better performance for tasks such as analytical queries and in-database embeddings.  It is recommend you use it within a [Shared VPC](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc) with your Cloud Run runtime, which will expose AlloyDB's private ip address to your application.  If you are using it the DB connection string changes slightly:

```
# ALLOYDB_CONNECTION_STRING
postgresql://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@<ALLOY_DB_PRIVATE_IP>:5432/<ALLOY_DB_DATABASE>/?sslmode=none&pgbouncer=true
```

```
# ALLOYDB_DIRECT_URL
postgresql://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@<ALLOY_DB_PRIVATE_IP>:5432/<ALLOY_DB_DATABASE>/?sslmode=none
```

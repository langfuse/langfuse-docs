# Self-Hosting Guide

[![Docker Image](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-langfuse-blue?logo=Docker&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/pkgs/container/langfuse)

Langfuse Server, which includes the API and Web UI, is open-source and can be self-hosted using Docker.

For a detailed component and architecture diagram, refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Prerequisites: Postgres Database

Langfuse requires a persistent Postgres database to store its state. You can use a managed service on AWS, Azure, or GCP, or host it yourself. Once the database is ready, keep the connection string handy.

## Deploying the Application

Deploy the application container to your infrastructure. You can use managed services like AWS ECS, Azure Container Instances, or GCP Cloud Run, or host it yourself.

During the container startup, all database migrations will be applied automatically.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/langfuse/langfuse:latest
```

```bash
docker run --name langfuse \
-e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname> \
-e NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
-e NEXTAUTH_SECRET=mysecret \
-e SALT=mysalt \
-p 3000:3000 \
-a STDOUT \
ghcr.io/langfuse/langfuse:latest
```

### Configuring Environment Variables

Langfuse can be configured using environment variables ([.env.prod.example](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/main/.env.prod.example)). Some are mandatory as defined in the table below:

| Variable                                                                                 | Required / Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Instead of `DATABASE_URL`, you can also use `DATABASE_HOST`, `DATABASE_USERNAME`, `DATABASE_PASSWORD` and `DATABASE_NAME`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Health Check Endpoint

Langfuse includes a health check endpoint at `/api/public/health`. This endpoint checks both API functionality and database connectivity.

Access the health check endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/public/health
```

The potential responses from the health check endpoint are:

- `200 OK`: Both the API is functioning normally and a successful connection to the database was made.
- `503 Service Unavailable`: Either the API is not functioning or it couldn't establish a connection to the database.

Applications and monitoring services can call this endpoint periodically for health updates.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, ensure the following:

- `NEXTAUTH_URL` exactly matches the URL you're accessing Langfuse with. Pay attention to the protocol (http vs https) and the port (e.g., 3000 if you do not expose Langfuse on port 80).
- Set `HOSTNAME` to `0.0.0.0` if you cannot access Langfuse.
- SSO: Ensure that the OAuth provider is configured correctly. The return path needs to match the `NEXTAUTH_URL`, and the OAuth client needs to be configured with the correct callback URL.
- Encode special characters in `DATABASE_URL`, see this StackOverflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68213745) for details.
- If you use the SDKs to connect with Langfuse, use `auth_check()` to verify that the connection works.

### How to update

To update the application:

1. Stop the container.
2. Pull the latest container.
3. Restart the application.

During container startup, any necessary database migrations will be applied automatically if the database schema has changed.

We recommend enabling automated updates to benefit from the latest features, bug fixes, and security patches.

### Apply newly supported models to existing data in Langfuse [#migrate-models]

Langfuse includes a list of supported models for [usage and cost tracking](/docs/model-usage-and-cost). If a Langfuse update includes support for new models, these will only be applied to newly ingested traces/generations.

Optionally, you can apply the new model definitions to existing data using the following steps. During the migration, the database remains available (non-blocking).

1. Clone the repository and create an `.env` file:

   ```bash
   # Clone the Langfuse repository
   git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git

   # Navigate to the Langfuse directory
   cd langfuse

   # Install all dependencies
   npm i

   # Create an .env file
   cp .env.dev.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` to connect to your database from your machine:

   ```bash filename=".env"
   NODE_ENV=production

   # Replace with your database connection string
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
   ```

3. Execute the migration. Depending on the size of your database, this might take a while.

   ```bash
   npm run models:migrate
   ```

4. Clean up: remove the `.env` file to avoid connecting to the production database from your local machine.

### Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run)

Cloud Run is an excellent method for deploying Langfuse easily and at scale. Cloud Run does not support deploying containers directly from the GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) used by Langfuse. To avoid the need to pull the container and push it to the Google registry, you can refer to this [guide](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1013#discussioncomment-8328524) or use Cloud Build.

### AWS (Fargate)

Deploy Langfuse to AWS using the AWS Fargate service for serverless container deployment. You can find the deployment guide and Cloud Development Kit (CDK) scripts here: [AI4Organization/langfuse-ecr-ecs-deployment-cdk](https://github.com/AI4Organization/langfuse-ecr-ecs-deployment-cdk).

### Kubernetes

Not really a platform, but Kubernetes is a popular way to deploy Langfuse. You can find community-maintained templates at [langfuse/langfuse-k8s](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-k8s).

## Support

If you experience any issues, please join us on [Discord](/discord) or contact the maintainers at support@langfuse.com.

For support with production deployments, the Langfuse team provides dedicated enterprise support. To learn more, reach out to enterprise@langfuse.com or [schedule a demo](/schedule-demo).

Alternatively, you may consider using [Langfuse Cloud](/docs/deployment/cloud), which is a fully managed version of Langfuse. You can find information about its security and privacy [here](/docs/data-security-privacy).

# Self-Hosting Guide

[![Docker Image](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-langfuse-blue?logo=Docker&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/pkgs/container/langfuse)

Langfuse Server, which includes the API and Web UI, is open-source and can be self-hosted using Docker.

For a detailed component and architecture diagram, refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Prerequisites: Postgres Database

Langfuse requires a persistent Postgres database to store its state. You can use a managed service on AWS, Azure, or GCP, or host it yourself. Once the database is ready, keep the connection string handy.

## Deploying the Application

Deploy the application container to your infrastructure. You can use managed services like AWS ECS, Azure Container Instances, or GCP Cloud Run, or host it yourself.

During the container startup, all database migrations will be applied automatically.

We follow _semantic versioning_ for Langfuse releases, i.e. breaking changes are only introduced in a new major version.

- We recommend [automated updates](#update) within a major version to benefit from the latest features, bug fixes, and security patches.
- Subscribe to our mailing list to get notified about new releases and new major versions.

### Configuring Environment Variables

Langfuse can be configured using environment variables ([.env.prod.example](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/main/.env.prod.example)). Some are mandatory as defined in the table below:

| Variable                                                                                 | Required / Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Instead of `DATABASE_URL`, you can also use `DATABASE_HOST`, `DATABASE_USERNAME`, `DATABASE_PASSWORD` and `DATABASE_NAME`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Use this if you want to use a different user for migrations or use connection pooling on `DATABASE_URL`. **For large deployments**, configure the database user with long timeouts as migrations might need a while to complete.                                                                                            |

This is often the case if you use a Cloud database. Refer to the [Prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/understanding-prisma-migrate/shadow-database#cloud-hosted-shadow-databases-must-be-created-manually) for detailed instructions. |

### Health Check Endpoint

Langfuse includes a health check endpoint at `/api/public/health`. This endpoint checks both API functionality and database connectivity.

Access the health check endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/public/health
```

The potential responses from the health check endpoint are:

- `200 OK`: Both the API is functioning normally and a successful connection to the database was made.
- `503 Service Unavailable`: Either the API is not functioning or it couldn't establish a connection to the database.

Applications and monitoring services can call this endpoint periodically for health updates.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, ensure the following:

- `NEXTAUTH_URL` exactly matches the URL you're accessing Langfuse with. Pay attention to the protocol (http vs https) and the port (e.g., 3000 if you do not expose Langfuse on port 80).
- Set `HOSTNAME` to `0.0.0.0` if you cannot access Langfuse.
- SSO: Ensure that the OAuth provider is configured correctly. The return path needs to match the `NEXTAUTH_URL`, and the OAuth client needs to be configured with the correct callback URL.
- Encode special characters in `DATABASE_URL`, see this StackOverflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68213745) for details.
- If you use the SDKs to connect with Langfuse, use `auth_check()` to verify that the connection works.

### How to update

To update the application:

1. Stop the container.
2. Pull the latest container.
3. Restart the application.

During container startup, any necessary database migrations will be applied automatically if the database schema has changed.

We recommend enabling automated updates to benefit from the latest features, bug fixes, and security patches.

### Apply newly supported models to existing data in Langfuse [#migrate-models]

Langfuse includes a list of supported models for [usage and cost tracking](/docs/model-usage-and-cost). If a Langfuse update includes support for new models, these will only be applied to newly ingested traces/generations.

Optionally, you can apply the new model definitions to existing data using the following steps. During the migration, the database remains available (non-blocking).

1. Clone the repository and create an `.env` file:

   ```bash
   # Clone the Langfuse repository
   git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git

   # Navigate to the Langfuse directory
   cd langfuse

   # Install all dependencies
   pnpm i

   # Create an .env file
   cp .env.dev.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` to connect to your database from your machine:

   ```bash filename=".env"
   NODE_ENV=production

   # Replace with your database connection string
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
   ```

3. Execute the migration. Depending on the size of your database, this might take a while.

   ```bash
   pnpm run models:migrate
   ```

4. Clean up: remove the `.env` file to avoid connecting to the production database from your local machine.

### Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run)

To host Langfuse on Google Cloud Run, you need to follow these steps using Google Cloud Build because Google Cloud Run doesn't support GitHub Container Registry:

1. First, mirror the latest release of Langfuse to your private GitHub repository. You can do this by using [this link](https://github.com/new/import). Note: Make sure to mirror the `production` branch, the Langfuse `main` branch includes unreleased features and might not be stable.

2. Whenever there's a new tagged release, merge the latest commit on the Langfuse `production` branch into the `production` branch of your private GitHub repository.

3. Push the `production` branch to your private repository, which now contains the new tagged release. This action will automatically deploy Langfuse on Google Cloud Run.

> Note: You can use the Slack RSS app to monitor the Langfuse [release feed here](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/releases.atom).

**Setup Project on Google Cloud Run**

1. Open Google Cloud Run.
2. Click on Create Service.
3. Choose GitHub integration to deploy from a repository continuously. Then click on Set up with Cloud Build.
4. Authorize Google Cloud access to your GitHub and select the repository.
5. In the Build Configuration, change the branch to production (i.e. `^production$`).
6. Select Build Type as Dockerfile and specify the source location as `/web/Dockerfile`.
7. Click on Save.
8. Now, Configure the service name and region according to your requirements.
9. Select authentication as 'Allow unauthenticated invocations', as Langfuse will have its own built-in Authentication that you can use.
10. Choose 'CPU Allocation and Pricing' as "CPU is only allocated during request processing" to scale down the instance to 0 when there are no requests.
11. Configure ingress control according to your needs. For most cases, 'All' should suffice.
12. Under "Container(s), Volumes, Networking & Security", specify container port as `3000`. Then click the "Secrets & Variables" tab. Add the required environment variables: `SALT`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, and `DATABASE_URL`, etc.
13. The `NEXTAUTH_URL` will be the URL of the deployed service, which you can update later when the service finishes building and gets deployed.
14. Now, set up the database. Note: Your Cloud Run service won't be assigned a static IP, so you can't whitelist the ingress IP in Cloud SQL or any other hosted databases. Instead, utilize the Google Cloud Proxy. Scroll down to "Cloud SQL connections" and enable access to the SQL instance hosting the database for Langfuse. After that, go to the "Secrets & Variables" section of the Container setup and add `DATABASE_URL` as an environment variable.

    Here's what the value should look like:

    ```
    postgresql://<user-name>:<password>@localhost/<db-name>/?host=/cloudsql/<google-cloud-project-id>:<region-id>:<sql-instance-id>&sslmode=none&pgbouncer=true
    ```

    Also, set `DIRECT_URL` for database migrations, without `&pgbouncer=true`, the value should look like this:

    ```
    postgresql://<user-name>:<password>@localhost/<db-name>/?host=/cloudsql/<google-cloud-project-id>:<region-id>:<sql-instance-id>&sslmode=none
    ```

15. Finally, you can finish deploying the application.

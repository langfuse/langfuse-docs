# Continuous technical documentation of Langfuse V3

Langfuse V3 is currently in development, see this [GitHub Discussion thread](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1902) for more information.

This document summarizes changes compared to v2 with regards to self-hosted deployments. While v3 is not released, these changes are unstable and can change.

## SDK compatibility

Langfuse V3 will not be compatible with JS and Python SDKs versions below 2.0.0. The 1.x.x SDKs use deprecated APIs for inserting tracing data into Langfuse. These APIs depend on synchronous event processing and return the final database state of an object via the API. As Langfuse scales, we use a queue to process events asynchronously, meaning the final state of an object is not immediately available via the API. This means that SDKs will break when trying to deserialize the response from the API into an object.

If you are using the 1.x.x SDKs, you must upgrade to the 2.x.x SDKs to use Langfuse V3. You can find the updated SDKs here: [Python](https://pypi.org/project/langfuse/), [JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/langfuse).

## Event Backups in Cloud Storage

In addition to storing events in the database, you may want to store a backup of all raw incoming events in a cloud storage bucket.
Use the `LANGFUSE_S3_EVENT_UPLOAD_*` environment variables to configure this.

| Environment Variable                         | Description                                                                   | Example                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `LANGFUSE_S3_EVENT_UPLOAD_ENABLED`           | Enable raw event uploads to cloud storage                                     | `true`                                     |
| `LANGFUSE_S3_EVENT_UPLOAD_BUCKET`            | The bucket that should store raw events                                       | `my-bucket`                                |
| `LANGFUSE_S3_EVENT_UPLOAD_PREFIX`            | (optional) Prefix to use within the bucket. Must end with `/` if provided.    | `events/`                                  |
| `LANGFUSE_S3_EVENT_UPLOAD_ENDPOINT`          | (optional) API endpoint to use. Must be S3 compatible.                        | `s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`               |
| `LANGFUSE_S3_EVENT_UPLOAD_REGION`            | (optional) Region to use.                                                     | `us-east-1`                                |
| `LANGFUSE_S3_EVENT_UPLOAD_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     | (optional) Access key id to use. Falls back to standard credential chain.     | `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`                     |
| `LANGFUSE_S3_EVENT_UPLOAD_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | (optional) Access key secret to use. Falls back to standard credential chain. | `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY` |

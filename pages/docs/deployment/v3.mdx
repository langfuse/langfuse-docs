# Continuous technical documentation of Langfuse V3

Langfuse V3 is currently in development, see this [GitHub Discussion thread](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1902) for more information.

This document summarizes changes compared to v2 with regards to self-hosted deployments. While v3 is not released, these changes are unstable and can change.

## Reasoning

Langfuse has gained traction over the last months and so we are working on scaling the backend to handle more requests. On Langfuse Cloud, we gradually move to the more scalable backend and want to release it to self-hosters by the end of November. The new version contains two Docker containers, Postgres, Redis, S3, and Clickhouse.


## SDK compatibility

<Callout type="warning">
  Cloud users: SDK versions below 2.0.0 need to be upgraded until Nov. 10th, 2024. Please upgrade your SDKs to the latest version.
</Callout>

Langfuse V3 is not completely backwards compatible with our SDKs on versions below 2.0.0. If you use a SDK with major version 1, please upgrade. With this, you will also get many features and improvements such as [prompt caching](https://langfuse.com/changelog/2024-02-05-sdk-level-prompt-caching) and many performance improvements.


**Upgrade options**:
- Default SDK upgrade: We wrote documentation on how to upgrade from 1.x.x to 2.x.x ([Python](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python/low-level-sdk#upgrading-from-v1xx-to-v2xx), [JS](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/typescript/guide#upgrade1to2)). For the JS SDK, we also have an upgrade path [from 2.x.x to 3.x.x](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/typescript/guide#upgrade2to3). The upgrade is straightforward and should not take much time.
- Improved integrations: Since the first major version, we built many new ways to integrate your code with Langfuse such as [Decorators](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python/decorators) for Python. We would recommend to check out our [quickstart](https://langfuse.com/docs/get-started) to see whether there is a more convenient integration available for you.


**Background**: Langfuse V3 relies on an event driven backend architecture. This means, that we acknowledge HTTP requests from the SKDs, queue the HTTP bodies in the backend, and process them asynchronously. This allows us to scale the backend more easily and handle more requests without overloading the database. The SDKs below 2.0.0 send the events to our server and expect a synchronous response containing the database representation of the event. If you rely on this data and access it in the code, your SDK will break as of Nov. 11th, 2024.

## Event Backups in Cloud Storage

In addition to storing events in the database, you may want to store a backup of all raw incoming events in a cloud storage bucket.
Use the `LANGFUSE_S3_EVENT_UPLOAD_*` environment variables to configure this.

| Environment Variable                         | Description                                                                   | Example                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `LANGFUSE_S3_EVENT_UPLOAD_ENABLED`           | Enable raw event uploads to cloud storage                                     | `true`                                     |
| `LANGFUSE_S3_EVENT_UPLOAD_BUCKET`            | The bucket that should store raw events                                       | `my-bucket`                                |
| `LANGFUSE_S3_EVENT_UPLOAD_PREFIX`            | (optional) Prefix to use within the bucket. Must end with `/` if provided.    | `events/`                                  |
| `LANGFUSE_S3_EVENT_UPLOAD_ENDPOINT`          | (optional) API endpoint to use. Must be S3 compatible.                        | `s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`               |
| `LANGFUSE_S3_EVENT_UPLOAD_REGION`            | (optional) Region to use.                                                     | `us-east-1`                                |
| `LANGFUSE_S3_EVENT_UPLOAD_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     | (optional) Access key id to use. Falls back to standard credential chain.     | `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`                     |
| `LANGFUSE_S3_EVENT_UPLOAD_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | (optional) Access key secret to use. Falls back to standard credential chain. | `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY` |

description: How Langfuse uses ClickHouse

# ClickHouse

ClickHouse is the main storage solution within Langfuse for our Trace, Observation, and Score entities.
It is optimized for high write throughput and fast analytical queries.
This guide covers how to configure ClickHouse within Langfuse and what to keep in mind when bringing your own ClickHouse.

## Configuration

Langfuse accepts the following environment variables to fine-tune your ClickHouse usage.
They need to be provided for the Langfuse Web and Langfuse Worker containers.

| Variable                                      | Required / Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CLICKHOUSE_MIGRATION_URL`                    | Required           | Migration URL (TCP protocol) for the ClickHouse instance. Pattern: `clickhouse://<hostname>:(9000/9440)` |
| `CLICKHOUSE_MIGRATION_SSL`                    | `false`            | Set to true to establish an SSL connection to ClickHouse for the database migration. |
| `CLICKHOUSE_URL`                              | Required           | Hostname of the ClickHouse instance. Pattern: `http(s)://<hostname>:(8123/8443)` |
| `CLICKHOUSE_USER`                             | Required           | Username of the ClickHouse database. Needs SELECT, ALTER, INSERT, CREATE, DELETE grants.   |
| `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD`                         | Required           | Password of the ClickHouse user. |
| `CLICKHOUSE_MIGRATION_CLUSTER_DISABLED`       | `false`            | Whether to disable the automatic ClickHouse migrations during server start. |
| `LANGFUSE_AUTO_CLICKHOUSE_MIGRATION_DISABLED` | `false`            | Whether to disable automatic ClickHouse migrations. |

Please note, that Langfuse uses the `default` schema and `default` cluster.
Get in touch with us on [Discord](/discord) or contact the maintainers at support@langfuse.com if this limitation is blocking.

Langfuse only supports ClickHouse versions >= 24.3.

## Deployment Options

This section covers different deployment options and provides example environment variables.

### ClickHouse Cloud

ClickHouse Cloud is a scalable and fully managed deployment option for ClickHouse.
You can provision it directly from [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.cloud/) or through one of the cloud provider marketplaces:
- [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-jettukeanwrfc)
- [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/clickhouse-public/clickhouse-cloud)
- [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/clickhouse.clickhouse_cloud?tab=Overview)

ClickHouse Cloud clusters will be provisioned outside your cloud environment and your VPC, but Clickhouse offers [private links](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/cloud/security/private-link-overview) for AWS, GCP, and Azure.

#### Example Configuration

Set the following environment variables to connect to your ClickHouse instance:

```yaml
CLICKHOUSE_URL=https://<identifier>.<region>.aws.clickhouse.cloud:8443
CLICKHOUSE_MIGRATION_URL=clickhouse://<identifier>.<region>.aws.clickhouse.cloud:9440
CLICKHOUSE_USER=default
CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=changeme
CLICKHOUSE_MIGRATION_SSL=true
```

#### Troubleshooting

- **'error: driver: bad connection in line 0' during migration**: If you see the previous error message during startup of your web container, ensure that the `CLICKHOUSE_MIGRATION_SSL` flag is set and that Langfuse Web can access your ClickHouse environment. Review the IP whitelisting if applicable and whether the instance has access to the Private Link.

### ClickHouse on Kubernetes (Helm)

The [Bitnami ClickHouse Helm Chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/clickhouse) provides a production ready deployment of ClickHouse using a given Kubernetes cluster.
We use it as a dependency for [Langfuse K8s](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/clickhouse).
See [Langfuse on Kubernetes (Helm)](/docs/deployment/v3/guides/kubernetes-helm) for more details on how to deploy Langfuse on Kubernetes.

#### Example Configuration

For a minimum production setup, we recommend to use the following values.yaml overwrites when deploying the Clickhouse Helm chart:

```yaml
clickhouse:
  deploy: true
  shards: 1 # Fixed: Langfuse does not support multi-shard clusters
  replicaCount: 3
  resourcesPreset: large # or more
  auth:
    username: default
    password: changeme
```

- **shards**: Shards are used for horizontally scaling ClickHouse. A single ClickHouse shared can handle multiple Terabytes of data. Today, Langfuse does not support a multi-shard cluster, i.e. this value _must_ be set to 1. Please get in touch with us if you hit scaling limits of a single shard cluster.
- **replicaCount**: The number of replicas for each shard. ClickHouse counts the all instances towards the number of replicas, i.e. a replica count of 1 means no redundancy at all. We recommend a minimum of 3 replicas for production setups. The number of replicas cannot be increased at runtime without manual intervention or downtime.
- **resourcesPreset**: ClickHouse is CPU and memory intensive for analytical and highly concurrent requests. We recommend at least the `large` resourcesPreset and more for larger deployments.
- **auth**: The username and password for the ClickHouse database. Overwrite those values according to your preferences, or mount them from a secret.
- **disk**: The ClickHouse Helm chart uses the default storage class to create volumes for each replica. Ensure that the storage class has `allowVolumeExpansion = true` as observability workloads tend to be very disk heavy. For cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure this should be the default.

Langfuse assumes that certain parameters are set in the ClickHouse configurations.
To perform our database migrations, the following values must be provided:
```xml
<!--
    Substitutions for parameters of replicated tables.
     Optional. If you don't use replicated tables, you could omit that.
     See https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/replication/#creating-replicated-tables
-->
<!--
    <macros>
        <shard>01</shard>
        <replica>example01-01-1</replica>
    </macros>
-->
<!--
    <default_replica_path>/clickhouse/tables/{database}/{table}</default_replica_path>
    <default_replica_name>{replica}</default_replica_name>
-->
```
`macros` and `default_replica_*` configuration should be covered by the Helm chart without any further configuration.

Set the following environment variables to connect to your ClickHouse instance assuming that Langfuse runs within the same Cluster and Namespace:

```yaml
CLICKHOUSE_URL=http://<chart-name>-clickhouse:8123
CLICKHOUSE_MIGRATION_URL=clickhouse://<chart-name>-clickhouse:9000
CLICKHOUSE_USER=default
CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=changeme
```

### Docker

You can run ClickHouse in a single [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/clickhouse/clickhouse-server) container for development purposes.
As there is no redundancy, this is **not recommended for production workloads**.

#### Example Configuration

Start the container with
```bash
docker run --name clickhouse-server \
  -e CLICKHOUSE_DB=default \
  -e CLICKHOUSE_USER=clickhouse \
  -e CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=clickhouse \
  -d --ulimit nofile=262144:262144 \
  -p 8123:8123 \
  -p 9000:9000 \
  -p 9009:9009 \
  clickhouse/clickhouse-server
```

Set the following environment variables to connect to your ClickHouse instance:

```yaml
CLICKHOUSE_URL=http://localhost:8123
CLICKHOUSE_MIGRATION_URL=clickhouse://localhost:9000
CLICKHOUSE_USER=clickhouse
CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=clickhouse
CLICKHOUSE_MIGRATION_CLUSTER_DISABLED=true
```

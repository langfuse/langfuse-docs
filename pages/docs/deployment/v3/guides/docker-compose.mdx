# Self-hosted deployment - Docker Compose

This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy Langfuse on a cloud provider using Docker Compose.
You will need access to a cloud provider like AWS, GCP, or Azure to deploy the application with permissions to deploy a virtual machine.
While the Docker Compose setup can be highly effective for development environments, we recommend to **not use it in production**.
There is no high-availability, no automatic restarts, no scaling, and no backup.

## Start a new instance

Enter your cloud provider interface and navigate to the VM instance section.
This is EC2 on AWS, Compute Engine on GCP, and Virtual Machines on Azure.
Create a new instance.
We recommend that you use at least 4 cores and 16 GiB of memory, e.g. a t3.xlarge on AWS.
Assign a public IP address in case you want to send traces from external sources.
As observability data tends to be large in volume, choose a sufficient amount of storage, e.g. 100GiB.

The rest of this guide will assume that you have an Ubuntu OS running on your VM and are connected via SSH.

## Install Docker and Docker Compose

Install docker (see [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) as well).

Setup Docker's apt repository:
```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

Install Docker packages:
```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

Verify installlation:
```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

## Clone Langfuse Repository

Get a copy of the latest Langfuse repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git

cd langfuse
```

## Start the application

For local experimentation, the pre-configured variables in the docker-compose file are usually sufficient.
If you send _any_ kind of sensitive data to the application or intend to keep it up for longer, we recommend that
you modify the docker-compose file and overwrite the following environment variables:

- **SALT**: A random string used to hash passwords. It should be at least 32 characters long.
- **ENCRYPTION_KEY**: Generate this via `openssl rand -base64 32`.
- **NEXTAUTH_SECRET**: A random string used to sign JWT tokens.
- **NEXTAUTH_URL**: The URL where the application is hosted. Used for redirects after signup.

In addition, you should change any database or storage credential.

Run the docker compose file for Langfuse v3:
```bash
docker compose up
```

Watch the containers being started and the logs flowing in.
After about 2-3 minutes, the langfuse-web-1 container should log "Ready".
At this point you can proceed to the next step.

## Smoke test UI

You should be able to load the Langfuse UI, by opening `http://<instance-ip>:3000/` in your browser.
Go ahead and register, create a new organization, project, and explore Langfuse.

## Shutdown

You can stop the containers by hitting `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
If you started docker-compose in the background (`-d` flag), you can stop all instance using:
```bash
docker compose down
```
Adding the `-v` flag will also remove the volumes.

Ensure to stop the VM instance in your cloud provider interface to avoid unnecessary costs.

## How to Upgrade

To upgrade Langfuse, you can stop all instances and run `docker compose up --pull always`.

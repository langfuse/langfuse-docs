# Self-hosted deployment - v3 Preview - Open Source LLM Observability

<Callout type="warning">
  This guide covers a developer preview which is **not suitable for production use**.
  v3 is under active development and we plan to ship a production-ready version by the end of November 2024.
  We share this information to gather feedback from our awesome developer community.

  For a production-ready setup, follow the [self-hosting guide](/docs/deployment/self-host)
  or consider using [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com) maintained by the Langfuse team.

  If you are on a v2 setup and want to migrate to the v3 developer preview (not recommended in production environments), take a look at our [migration guide](/docs/deployment/v3/migrate-v2-to-v3).

  If you face any questions or issues, please reach out to us on [Discord](/discord), contact the maintainers at support@langfuse.com,
  or join the [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1902).

## Components

Langfuse consists of multiple storage components and two Docker containers:

- **Langfuse Web**: The main web application serving the Langfuse UI and APIs.
- **Langfuse Worker**: A worker that asynchronously processes events.
- **Postgres**: The main database for transactional workloads.
- **Redis**: A fast in-memory data structure store. Used for queue and cache operations.
- **S3/Blob Store**: Object storage to persist all incoming events, multi-modal inputs, and large exports.
- **Clickhouse**: High-performance OLAP database which stores traces, observations, and scores.

See the chart below for an overview of the components and their interactions:

### Postgres Database

Langfuse requires a persistent Postgres database to store its state.
You can use a managed service on AWS, Azure, or GCP, or host it yourself.
At least version 12 is required.

### Redis

Langfuse uses Redis for caching and queue operations.
You can use a managed service on AWS, Azure, or GCP, or host it yourself.
At least version 7 is required and the instance must have `maxmemory-policy=noeviction` configured.
You may use Valkey instead of Redis, but there is no active support from the Langfuse team as of now.

### S3/Blob Store

Langfuse requires an S3-compatible blob store to persist all incoming events, multi-modal inputs, and large exports.
You can use a managed service on AWS, Azure, or GCP, or host it yourself using MinIO.

### Clickhouse

Langfuse uses Clickhouse as an OLAP database to store traces, observations, and scores.
You can use the managed service by Clickhouse Cloud, or host it yourself.
See [ClickHouse](/docs/deployment/v3/components/clickhouse) for more details on how to connect ClickHouse to Langfuse.

## Deploying Langfuse

Deploy the application container to your infrastructure.
You can use managed services like AWS ECS, Azure Container Instances, or GCP Cloud Run, or host it yourself.

During the container startup, all database migrations will be applied automatically.
This can be optionally disabled via environment variables.

  -a STDOUT \
langfuse/langfuse-worker:latest # TODO: Update to tagged version
```

### Recommended sizing

For production environments, we recommend to use at least 2 CPUs and 4 GB of RAM for all containers.
You should have at least two instances of the Langfuse Web container for high availability.
For auto-scaling, we recommend to add instances once the CPU utilization exceeds 50% on either container.

### Environment Variables

Langfuse accepts additional environment variables to fine-tune your deployment.
You can use the same environment variables for the Langfuse Web and Langfuse Worker containers.

| Variable                                                                                             | Required / Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

This is often the case if you use a Cloud database. Refer to the [Prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/understanding-prisma-migrate/shadow-database#cloud-hosted-shadow-databases-must-be-created-manually) for detailed instructions. |

### Authentication

#### Email/Password [#auth-email-password]

Email/password authentication is enabled by default. Users can sign up and log in using their email and password.

To disable email/password authentication, set `AUTH_DISABLE_USERNAME_PASSWORD=true`. In this case, you need to set up [SSO](#sso) instead.

If you want to provision a default user for your Langfuse instance, you can use the [`LANGFUSE_INIT_*`](#initialization) environment variables.

**Password Reset**

- **If transactional emails are configured** on your instance via the `SMTP_CONNECTION_URL` and `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` environments, users can reset their password by using the "Forgot password" link on the login page.

- **If transactional emails are not set up**, passwords can be reset by following these steps:
1.  Update the email associated with your user account in database, such as by adding a prefix.
2.  You can then sign up again with a new password.
3.  Reassign any organizations you were associated with via the `organization_memberships` table in database.
4.  Finally, remove the old user account from the `users` table in database.

#### SSO

To enable OAuth/SSO provider sign-in for Langfuse, add the following environment variables:

Use `*_ALLOW_ACCOUNT_LINKING` to allow merging accounts with the same email address. This is useful when users sign in with different providers or email/password but have the same email address. You need to be careful with this setting as it can lead to security issues if the emails are not verified.

Need another provider? Langfuse uses Auth.js, which integrates with [many providers](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/). Add a [feature request on GitHub](/ideas) if you want us to add support for a specific provider.

#### Additional configuration

| Variable                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AUTH_DOMAINS_WITH_SSO_ENFORCEMENT` | Comma-separated list of domains that are only allowed to sign in using SSO. Email/password sign in is disabled for these domains. E.g. `domain1.com,domain2.com`                                         |
| `AUTH_DISABLE_SIGNUP`               | Set to `true` to disable sign up for new users. Only existing users can sign in. This affects all new users that try to sign up, also those who received an invite to a project and have no account yet. |
| `AUTH_SESSION_MAX_AGE`              | Set the maximum age of the session (JWT) in minutes. The default is 30 days (`43200`). The value must be greater than 5 minutes, as the front-end application refreshes its session every 5 minutes.     |

### Headless Initialization [#initialization]

By default, you need to create a user account, organization and project via the Langfuse UI before being able to use the API. You can find the API keys in the project settings within the UI.

If you want to automatically initialize these resources, you can optionally use the following `LANGFUSE_INIT_*` environment variables. When these variables are set, Langfuse will automatically create the specified resources on startup if they don't already exist. This allows for easy integration with infrastructure-as-code and automated deployment pipelines.

| Environment Variable               | Description                            | Required to Create Resource | Example            |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `LANGFUSE_INIT_ORG_ID`             | Unique identifier for the organization | Yes                         | `my-org`           |
| `LANGFUSE_INIT_ORG_NAME`           | Name of the organization               | No                          | `My Org`           |
| `LANGFUSE_INIT_PROJECT_ID`         | Unique identifier for the project      | Yes                         | `my-project`       |
| `LANGFUSE_INIT_PROJECT_NAME`       | Name of the project                    | No                          | `My Project`       |
| `LANGFUSE_INIT_PROJECT_PUBLIC_KEY` | Public API key for the project         | Yes                         | `lf_pk_1234567890` |
| `LANGFUSE_INIT_PROJECT_SECRET_KEY` | Secret API key for the project         | Yes                         | `lf_sk_1234567890` |
| `LANGFUSE_INIT_USER_EMAIL`         | Email address of the initial user      | Yes                         | `user@example.com` |
| `LANGFUSE_INIT_USER_NAME`          | Name of the initial user               | No                          | `John Doe`         |
| `LANGFUSE_INIT_USER_PASSWORD`      | Password for the initial user          | Yes                         | `password123`      |

The different resources depend on each other in the following way. You can e.g. intialize an organization and a user wihtout having to also initialize a project and API keys, but you cannot initialize a project without also initializing an organization.

```
Organization
├── Project      (part of organization)
│   └── API Keys (set for project)
└── User         (owner of organization)
```

Troubleshooting:

- If you use `LANGFUSE_INIT_*` in Docker Compose, do not double-quote the values ([GitHub issue](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/issues/3398)).
- The resources depend on one another (see note above). For example, you must create an organization to initialize a project.

### Configuring the Enterprise Edition [#ee]

The Enterprise Edition ([compare versions](/docs/deployment/feature-overview)) of Langfuse includes additional optional configuration options that can be set via environment variables.

| `LANGFUSE_UI_DOCUMENTATION_HREF`                                         | Customize the documentation link reference in the menu and settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `LANGFUSE_UI_SUPPORT_HREF`                                               | Customize the support link reference in the menu and settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `LANGFUSE_UI_FEEDBACK_HREF`                                              | Replace the default feedback widget with your own feedback link.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `LANGFUSE_UI_LOGO_DARK_MODE_HREF`<br/>`LANGFUSE_UI_LOGO_LIGHT_MODE_HREF` | Co-brand the Langfuse interface with your own logo. Langfuse adapts to the logo width, with a maximum aspect ratio of 1:3. Narrower ratios (e.g., 2:3, 1:1) also work. The logo is fitted into a bounding box, so there are no specific pixel constraints. For reference, the example logo is 160px x 400px. |
| `LANGFUSE_UI_DEFAULT_MODEL_ADAPTER`                                      | Set the default model adapter for the LLM playground and evals. Options: `OpenAI`, `Anthropic`, `Azure`. Example: `Anthropic`                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `LANGFUSE_UI_DEFAULT_BASE_URL_OPENAI`                                    | Set the default base URL for OpenAI API in the LLM playground and evals. Example: `https://api.openai.com/v1`                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `LANGFUSE_UI_DEFAULT_BASE_URL_ANTHROPIC`                                 | Set the default base URL for Anthropic API in the LLM playground and evals. Example: `https://api.anthropic.com`                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `LANGFUSE_UI_DEFAULT_BASE_URL_AZURE_OPENAI`                              | Set the default base URL for Azure OpenAI API in the LLM playground and evals. Example: `https://{instanceName}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments`                                                                                                                                                         |

### Health and Readiness Check Endpoint

Langfuse web includes a health check endpoint at `/api/public/health` and a readiness check endpoint at `/api/public/ready` and the
Langfuse worker a health check endpoint at `/api/health`.
The health check endpoint indicates if the application is alive and the readiness check endpoint indicates if the application is ready to serve traffic.

Access the health and readiness check endpoints:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/public/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/public/ready
curl http://localhost:3030/api/health
```

The potential responses from the health check endpoint are:

- `200 OK`: Both the API is functioning normally and a successful connection to the database was made.
- `503 Service Unavailable`: Either the API is not functioning or it couldn't establish a connection to the database.

The potential responses from the readiness check endpoint are:

- `200 OK`: The application is ready to serve traffic.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: The application received a SIGTERM or SIGINT and should not receive traffic.

Applications and monitoring services can call this endpoint periodically for health updates.

Per default, the Langfuse web healthcheck endpoint does not validate if the database is reachable, as there are cases where the
database is unavailable, but the application still serves traffic.
If you want to run database healthchecks, you can add `?failIfDatabaseUnavailable=true` to the healthcheck endpoint.

### Encryption

#### Encryption in transit (HTTPS) [#https]

For encryption in transit, HTTPS is strongly recommended.
Langfuse itself does not handle HTTPS directly.
Instead, HTTPS is typically managed at the infrastructure level.
There are two main approaches to handle HTTPS for Langfuse:

1. Load Balancer Termination:
In this approach, HTTPS is terminated at the load balancer level.
The load balancer handles the SSL/TLS certificates and encryption, then forwards the decrypted traffic to the Langfuse container over HTTP.
This is a common and straightforward method, especially in cloud environments.

- Pros: Simplifies certificate management as it is usually a fully managed service (e.g. AWS ALB), offloads encryption overhead from application servers.
- Cons: Traffic between load balancer and Langfuse container is unencrypted (though typically within a secure network).

2. Service Mesh Sidecar:
This method involves using a service mesh like Istio or Linkerd.
A sidecar proxy is deployed alongside each Langfuse container, handling all network traffic including HTTPS.

- Pros: Provides end-to-end encryption (mutual TLS), offers advanced traffic management and observability.
- Cons: Adds complexity to the deployment, requires understanding of service mesh concepts.

Once HTTPS is enabled, you can configure add `LANGFUSE_CSP_ENFORCE_HTTPS=true` to ensure browser only allow HTTPS connections when using Langfuse.

#### Encryption at rest (database) [#encryption-at-rest]

All Langfuse data is stored in your Postgres database, Clickhouse, Redis, or S3/Blob Store.
Database-level encryption is recommended for a secure production deployment and available across cloud providers.

The Langfuse team has implemented this for Langfuse Cloud and it is fully ISO27001, SOC2 Type 2 and GDPR compliant ([security page](/docs/security)).

#### Additional application-level encryption [#application-level-encryption]

In addition to in-transit and at-rest encryption, sensitive data is also encrypted or hashed at the application level.

## Deployment Guides

The Langfuse team and our community maintain a collection of deployment guides to illustrate how you can run Langfuse in various environments.
This section is work in progress and relies on community contributions.
If you have successfully deployed Langfuse on a specific platform, consider contributing a guide either via a GitHub [PR/Issue](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-docs)
or by [reaching out](#contact) to the maintainers.
Please also let us know if one of these guides does not work anymore or if you have a better solution.

- [Kubernetes (Helm)](/docs/deployment/v3/guides/kubernetes-helm)

## Support

If you experience any issues, please join us on [Discord](/discord) or contact the maintainers at support@langfuse.com.

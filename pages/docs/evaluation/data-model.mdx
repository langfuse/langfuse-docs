# Evaluation Data Model

{/* todo: add datasets */}

{/* todo: simplify scores data model */}

Evaluation is critical for the LLM Application Development workflow. Also, it is very specific to a certain use case and application. Thus, the evaluation data model in Langfuse is flexible to represent any evaluation metric. It is used across the evalaution methods outlined in the [overview](/docs/scores/overview).

The core concepts are:

- [`Score`](#scores) is the core object for storing evaluation metrics
  - Scores reference a `Trace`, `Observation`, `Session`, or `DatasetRun`
  - Scores can optionally be linked to a [`ScoreConfig`](#score-config) to ensure they comply with a specific schema.
- [`Dataset`](#datasets) is a collection of `DatasetItem`s
  - `DatasetRun` is an experiment run on a `Dataset`, it is identified by a unique `name` and can be linked to a `ScoreConfig`
  - `DatasetRunItem` links a `DatasetItem` to a `Trace` created during an experiment
  - Evaluation metrics of a `DatasetRun` are based on `Scores` associated with the `Traces` linked to run

## Scores [#scores]

`Scores` serve as objects for storing evaluation metrics in Langfuse.

- Langfuse supports session and trace level scores. Optionally trace level scores can reference a specific observation within a trace ([tracing data model](/docs/observability/data-model)).
- Typically session level scores are used for comprehensive evaluation of conversational experiences across multiple interactions, while trace level scores are used for evaluation of a single interaction. Dataset run level scores typically attach overall performance scores to dataset run experiments. Trace level scores are used more widely across Langfuse.
- They can be _numeric_, _categorical_, or _boolean_.
- A `comment` can be added to provide additional context or information about the score.

Optionally, scores can be linked to a `score configuration` to ensure they comply with a specific schema. More on this below.

High-level data model and its relations to the [tracing](/docs/tracing/overview), [session data model](/docs/tracing-features/sessions) and [dataset runs](/docs/datasets/overview). A score must be associated with one and only one of trace, session, or dataset run.

  Score --> Session : optional
  Score --> DatasetRun : optional
  Score --> Trace : optional
  Score --> Observation : optional, reference observation within a trace
  Score --> ScoreConfig : optional, ensure schema

<summary>How are scores used across Langfuse?</summary>

Scores can be used in multiple ways across Langfuse:

1. Displayed on trace/session/dataset run to provide a quick overview
2. Segment all execution traces by scores to e.g. find all traces with a low quality score
3. Analytics: Detailed score reporting with drill downs into use cases and user segments

<summary>Frequently used scores</summary>

Scores in Langfuse are adaptable (it is just a `name`) and designed to cater to the unique requirements of specific LLM applications. They typically serve to measure the following aspects:

- Quality
  - Factual accuracy
  - Completeness of the information provided
  - Verification against hallucinations
- Style
  - Sentiment portrayed
  - Tonality of the content
  - Potential toxicity
- Security
  - Similarity to prevalent prompt injections
  - Instances of model refusals (e.g., as a language model, ...)

| `configId`      | string | Optional: Score config id to ensure that the score follows a specific schema. Can be defined in the Langfuse UI or via API. When provided the score's `dataType` is automatically set based on the config |

## Define schema via `score config` [#score-config]

If you'd like to ensure that your scores follow a specific schema, you can define a `score config` in the Langfuse UI or via our API.

A score config includes:

- Score name
- Data type: `NUMERIC`, `CATEGORICAL`, `BOOLEAN`
- Constraints on score value range:
  - Min/max values for numerical data types
  - Custom categories for categorical data types

Configs are immutable but can be archived (and restored anytime). Using score configs allows you to standardize your scoring schema across your team and ensure that scores are consistent and comparable for future analysis.

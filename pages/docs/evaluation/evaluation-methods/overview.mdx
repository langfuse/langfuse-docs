Scores are desiged to score evaluation metrics and can be created the following ways:

- [LLM-as-a-Judge](/docs/evaluation/evaluation-methods/llm-as-a-judge)
- [Scores via API/SDK](/docs/evaluation/evaluation-methods/custom-scores)
- [Scores via UI](/docs/evaluation/evaluation-methods/annotation)
- [Annotation Queues](/docs/evaluation/evaluation-methods/annotation-queues)

# Experiments Overview

Experiments allow you to systematically test your LLM application using a dataset, enabling you to evaluate and compare its performance. 

Each experiment is based on a [Dataset](/docs/evaluation/experiments/datasets) containing inputs and, optionally, expected outputs. This Dataset can be either local or hosted on Langfuse. For each input, the experiment runs a task functionâ€”this could be your LLM application when using [Experiments via SDK](/docs/evaluation/experiments/experiments-via-sdk), or a prompt sent to a model when using [Experiments via UI](/docs/evaluation/experiments/experiments-via-ui). 

The results can be assessed and scored using various [Evaluation Methods](/docs/evaluation/evaluation-methods/llm-as-a-judge).

## Running experiments

The matrix below shows the different experiment configurations based on where your data is hosted and where the experiment execution takes place:

While it's optional, we recommend managing the underlying [Datasets](/docs/evaluation/experiments/datasets) in Langfuse as it allows for [1] In-UI comparison tables of different experiments on the same data and [2] Iteratively improve dataset based on production/staging traces.

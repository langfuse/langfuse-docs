# User Feedback Tracking

User feedback is a great source to evaluate the quality of an LLM app's output.

<details>
<summary>What are common feedback types?</summary>

Depending on the type of the application, there are different **types of feedback** that can be collected that vary in quality, detail, and quantity.

- **Explicit Feedback**: Directly prompt the user to give feedback, this can be a rating, a like, a dislike, a scale or a comment. While it is simple to implement, quality and quantity of the feedback is often low.
- **Implicit Feedback**: Measure the user's behavior, e.g., time spent on a page, click-through rate, accepting/rejecting a model-generated output. This type of feedback is more difficult to implement but is often more frequent and reliable.

<details>
<summary>What is a common workflow of using user feedback?</summary>

A common workflow is to:

1. Collection of feedback alongside LLM traces in Langfuse
   > Example: _Negative, Langfuse not included in response_
2. Browsing of all user feedback, especially when collecting comments from users
3. Identification of the root cause of the low-quality response (can be managed via [annotation queues](/docs/scores/annotation))
   > Example: _Docs on Langfuse integration are not included in embedding similarity search_

## Get started

In Langfuse, any kind of user feedback can be collected as a `score` (see [evaluation data model](/docs/evaluation/data-model)) via the [Langfuse SDKs or API](/docs/evaluation/features/evaluation-methods/custom-scores) and attached to an execution `trace` or an individual `observation` ([tracing data model](/docs/observability/data-model)).

Types of user feedback that can be collected as a score:

- Be numeric (e.g. 1-5 stars)
- Be categorical (e.g. thumbs up/down)
- Be boolean (e.g. accept/reject)

## Integration Example

In this example, we use the [`LangfuseWeb` SDK](/docs/sdk/typescript/guide-web) to collect user feedback right from the browser.

**Note:** You can also use the SDKs server-side or add scores via the API.

**Integration**

```ts {1, 9, 17-18} filename="UserFeedbackComponent.tsx"
import { LangfuseWeb } from "langfuse";

export function UserFeedbackComponent(props: { traceId: string }) {
  const langfuseWeb = new LangfuseWeb({
    publicKey: env.NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY,
  });

  const handleUserFeedback = async (value: number) =>
    await langfuseWeb.score({
      traceId: props.traceId,
      name: "user_feedback",
      value,
    });

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => handleUserFeedback(1)}>👍</button>
      <button onClick={() => handleUserFeedback(0)}>👎</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

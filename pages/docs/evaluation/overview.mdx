title: Evaluation of LLM Applications
description: With Langfuse you can capture all your LLM evaluations in one place. You can combine a variety of different evaluation metrics like model-based evaluations (LLM-as-a-Judge), human annotations or fully custom evaluation workflows via API/SDKs. This allows you to measure quality, tonality, factual accuracy, completeness, and other dimensions of your LLM application.

# Evaluation Overview

Evals give you a repeatable check of your LLM application's behavior. You **replace guesswork with data**.

They also help you **catch regressions before you ship a change**. You tweak a prompt to handle an edge case, run your eval, and immediately see if it affected the behavior of your application in unintended ways.

## Getting Started

If you're new to LLM evaluation, start by exploring the [Concepts](/docs/evaluation/core-concepts) page. There's a lot to uncover, and going through the concepts before diving in will speed up your learning curve.

Once you know what you want to do, you can:

- [Create a dataset](/docs/evaluation/experiments/datasets) to measure your LLM application's performance consistently
- [Run an experiment](/docs/evaluation/core-concepts#experiments) get an overview of how your application is doing
- [Set up a live evaluator](/docs/evaluation/evaluation-methods/llm-as-a-judge) to monitor your live traces

Looking for something specific? Take a look under _Evaluation Methods_ and _Experiments_ for guides on specific topics.

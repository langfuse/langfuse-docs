# Fine-Tuning

Langfuse is [open-source](/open-source) and data tracked with Langfuse is open. You can easily [trace](/docs/tracing) your application, collect user feedback, and then use the data to fine-tune a model for your specific use case.

## Export generations

The generations table in Langfuse allows you to export all LLM calls recorded with Langfuse. All filters applied to the table will be applied to the export, thus, you can e.g. filter for a specific model or minimum evaluation threshold and then export the generations.

Available export formats:

- CSV
- JSON

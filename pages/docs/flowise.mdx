# Flowise Integration

**Flowise** ([GitHub](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise)) is a no-code builder to build your customized LLM flows with a drag&drop editor.

With the native integration, you can use Flowise to quickly create complex LLM applications in no-code and then use Langfuse to monitor and improve them.

## Mapping of Flowise to Langfuse

The integration automatically maps the following fields from Flowise to Langfuse:

| **Flowise** | **Langfuse** | **Notes**                                             |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| chatId      | userId       | The chatId represents an individual user in Langfuse. |

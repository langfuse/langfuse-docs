# Overview

Langfuse is an **open source LLM engineering platform** to help teams collaboratively **debug**, **analyze** and **iterate** on their LLM Applications.

## Core platform features

### Develop

- **Observability:** Instrument your app and start ingesting traces to Langfuse ([Quickstart](https://langfuse.com/docs/get-started), [Tracing](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing))
  - Track all LLM calls and all other relevant logics in your app
  - [Async SDKs](/docs/sdk/overview) for Python and JS/TS, and [API](https://api.reference.langfuse.com)
  - [Integrations](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations) for OpenAI SDK, Langchain, LiteLLM, Flowise and Langflow
- **Langfuse UI:** Inspect and debug complex logs and user sessions ([Demo](https://langfuse.com/docs/demo), [Tracing](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing))
- **Prompts:** Manage, version and deploy prompts from within Langfuse ([Prompt Management](https://langfuse.com/docs/prompts))

### Monitor

- **Analytics:** Track metrics (LLM cost, latency, quality) and gain insights from dashboards & data exports ([Analytics](https://langfuse.com/docs/analytics))
- **Evals:** Collect and calculate scores for your LLM completions ([Scores & Evaluations](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores))
  - Run [model-based evaluations](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/model-based-evals)
  - Collect [user feedback](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/user-feedback)
  - [Manually score](https://langfuse-docs-git-new-menu-langfuse.vercel.app/docs/scores/manually) observations in Langfuse

### Test

- **Experiments:** Track and test app behaviour before deploying a new version
  - [Datasets](https://langfuse.com/docs/datasets) let you test expected in and output pairs and benchmark performance before deployiong
  - Track versions and releases in your application ([Experimentation](https://langfuse.com/docs/experimentation), [Prompt Management](https://langfuse.com/docs/prompts))

## Why Langfuse?

- Open source
- Model and framework agnostic
- Built for production
- Incrementally adoptable - start with a single LLM call or integration, then expand to full tracing of complex chains/agents
- Use GET API to build downstream use cases

# Overview

Langfuse is an **open source LLM engineering platform** to help teams **debug**, **analyze** and **iterate** on their LLM Application â€“ together.

## Core platform features

### Develop

- **Observability:** Instrument your app and start ingesting traces to Langfuse ([Quickstart](https://langfuse.com/docs/get-started), [Tracing](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing))
  - Langfuse: [SDKs](/docs/sdk/overview) for Python and JS/TS, and [API](https://api.reference.langfuse.com)
  - [Integrations](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations) for OpenAI SDK, Langchain, LiteLLM, Flowise and Langflow
- **Langfuse UI:** Inspect and debug complex logs and user sessions ([Demo](https://langfuse.com/docs/demo), [Tracing](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing))
- **Prompts:** Manage, version and deploy prompts from within Langfuse ([Prompt Management](https://langfuse.com/docs/prompts))

### Monitor

- **Analytics:** Track metrics (LLM cost, latency, quality) and gain insights from dashboards & data exports ([Analytics](https://langfuse.com/docs/analytics))
- **Evals:** Collect and calculate scores for your LLM completions ([Scores & Evaluations](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores))
  - Run [model-based evaluations](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/model-based-evals)
  - Collect [user feedback](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/user-feedback)
  - [Manually score](https://langfuse-docs-git-new-menu-langfuse.vercel.app/docs/scores/manually) observations in Langfuse

### Test

- **Experiments:** Track and test app behaviour before deploying a new version
  - [Datasets](https://langfuse.com/docs/datasets) let you test expected in and output pairs and benchmark performance before deployiong
  - Track versions and releases in your application ([Experimentation](https://langfuse.com/docs/experimentation), [Prompt Management](https://langfuse.com/docs/prompts))

## Features

1. [Integrations](/docs/integrations): Data collection via SDKs
   - Tracing LLM chains by collecting specific data such as prompts, outputs and configurations
   - Fully async SDKs for [JS/TS (Node, Edge)](/docs/sdk/typescript) and [Python](/docs/sdk/python)
   - Integrations
     - Langchain ([Python](/docs/langchain/python), [JS/TS](/docs/langchain/typescript))
     - [OpenAI SDK (Python)](/docs/openai), drop-in replacement
     - [HTTP API](/docs/api)
     - Other: [LiteLLM](/docs/litellm), [Flowise](/docs/flowise), [Langflow](/docs/langflow)
1. [Nested traces](/docs/tracing)
   - Find the root cause of issues
   - Segment traces based on user feedback and other metrics
   - Track multiple traces in a single [session](/docs/sessions)
1. [Evaluation](/docs/scores): Measure quality of outputs via scores
   - [Manually in the Langfuse UI](/docs/scores/manually) (human-in-the-loop)
   - [User feedback](/docs/scores/user-feedback), explicit or implicit, optionally directly from the browser via [JS/TS Web SDK](/docs/sdk/typescript-web)
   - [Model-based evaluations](/docs/scores/model-based-evals)
   - [Custom via SDK/API](/docs/scores/custom)
1. [Analytics](/docs/analytics)
   - [User-level reporting](/docs/user-explorer): costs, usage, feedback/quality
   - [Model usage and cost](/docs/model-usage-and-cost)
1. [Prompt management](/docs/prompts) (beta)
   - Manage, version and deploy prompts collaboratively in Langfuse
   - Fetch prompts via SDKs

## Why Langfuse?

- [Open source](/docs/open-source) (MIT license)
- Model and framework agnostic
- Incrementally adoptable, start with a single LLM call or integration, expand to full tracing of complex chains/agents
- Use GET API to build downstream use cases

# Introduction

Langfuse is an **open-source product analytics suite for LLM apps**.

## Features

1. [Integrations](/docs/integrations): Data collection via SDKs
   - Tracing LLM chains by collecting specific data such as prompts, outputs, and configurations
   - Feedback collection from users
     - Explicit, e.g., thumbs up/down, star rating
     - Implicit, e.g., user copied the completion, user clicked on a link, user did not edit before submitting the suggested text
1. [Nested traces](/docs/tracing)
   - Find the root cause of issues
   - Segment traces based on user feedback and other metrics
1. [Product analytics](/docs/analytics) (in alpha)
   - Detailed monitoring of quality, cost and latency

## Benefits

- Open source
- Run Langfuse self-hosted, locally, or use Langfuse cloud
- Model agnostic
- Integration
  - Fully async, does not add latency
  - Fully typed SDKs for typescript and python
  - Report user feedback from front-end
  - Incrementally adoptable, start with a single LLM call, expand to full tracing of complex chains/agents

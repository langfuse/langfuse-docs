# Langfuse Overview

Langfuse is an **open-source LLM engineering platform** ([GitHub](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse)) that helps teams collaboratively debug, analyze, and iterate on their LLM applications. All platform features are natively integrated to accelerate the development workflow.

## Tracing

Tracing is essential for understanding and debugging LLM applications. Unlike traditional software, LLM applications involve complex, non-deterministic interactions that can be challenging to monitor and debug. Langfuse provides comprehensive tracing capabilities that help you understand exactly what's happening in your application.

- [Get started with tracing](/docs/get-started)
- Traces include all LLM and non-LLM calls, including retrieval, embedding, API calls, and more
- Support for tracking multi-turn conversations as sessions and user tracking
- Agents can be represented as graphs
- Capture traces via our [50+ Integrations & SDKs](/docs/integrations/overview)

## Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is critical in building effective LLM applications. Langfuse provides tools to help you manage, version, and optimize your prompts throughout the development lifecycle.

- [Get started with prompt management](/docs/prompts/get-started)
- Manage, version, and optimize your prompts throughout the development lifecycle
- Test prompts interactively in the [LLM Playground](/docs/playground)
- Run [prompt experiments](/docs/datasets/prompt-experiments) against datasets in order to test new prompt versions directly within Langfuse

## Evaluations

Evaluations are crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of your LLM applications. Langfuse provides flexible evaluation tools that adapt to your specific needs, whether you're testing in development or monitoring production performance.

- Get started with different forms of [automated or manual evaluation methods](/docs/scores/overview)
- Identify issues early by running evaluations on production traces
- [Datasets](/docs/datasets) are the foundation for systematic testing and improvement of your LLM applications. 
- Create and manage test sets that ensure your application performs reliably across different scenarios.

## Where to start?

Setting up the full process of online tracing, prompt management, production evaluations to identify issues, and offline evaluations on datasets requires some time. This guide is meant to help you figure out what is most important for your use case.

## Why Langfuse?

- [Open source](/docs/open-source) (MIT license)
- Run Langfuse [self-hosted](/docs/deployment/self-host), [locally](/docs/deployment/local), or use [Langfuse cloud](/docs/deployment/cloud)
- Model agnostic
- Integration

  - Fully async SDKs for:
    - [JS/TS (Node, Edge)](/docs/sdk/typescript)
    - [Python](/docs/sdk/python)
  - [Langchain integration](/docs/langchain) (full integration in 5 minutes)
  - [Public API](/docs/api)
  - [OpenAI SDK](/docs/openai) (drop-in replacement, change only the import)
  - [JS/TS Web SDK](/docs/sdk/typescript-web) to create scores from the client-side
  - Incrementally adoptable, start with a single LLM call, expand to full tracing of complex chains/agents

- Use [GET API](/docs/api) to build downstream use cases

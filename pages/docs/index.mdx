# Introduction


Welcome to the AssistMe platform! Our platform offers unique capabilities for creating AI Agents and AI Copilots for your business, significantly enhancing your productivity and efficiency. Let's go through the main steps for a quick start.

## Platform Overview

Get to know the main features and benefits of the AssistMe platform, including our unique search algorithm and the built-in document search mechanism.

### Agents - Intuitive and Easy to Use Setup Process


- **AI powered agents:** An Agent is a configured instance of an artificial intelligence capable of searching for documents, executing tasks using external tools, and  interacting with users via text or voice. Following the search phase, responses are generated by large language models such as  ChatGPT, Mistral, or LLaMA . Some of these AI agents, specifically designed to assist individuals with their daily tasks, are referred to as 'Co-pilots'

### Unique Features

- **Reduced Hallucinations:** Our algorithm minimizes errors and false information.
- **No-Code:** Easily create powerful AI agents without needing deep technical knowledge.
- **Advanced Document Search Mechanism:** Integrate and search your documents directly through the AI Copilot.

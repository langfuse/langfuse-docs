# Langfuse

> Langfuse is an **open-source LLM engineering platform** ([GitHub](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse)) that helps teams collaboratively debug, analyze, and iterate on their LLM applications. All platform features are natively integrated to accelerate the development workflow.

<details>
<summary>Why Langfuse?</summary>

- Most used open-source LLMOps platform ([blog post](/blog/2024-11-most-used-oss-llmops))
- Model and framework agnostic
- Built for production
- Incrementally adoptable, start with one feature and expand to the full platform over time
- API-first, all features are available via API for custom integrations
- Optionally, Langfuse can be easily self-hosted

<summary>Challenges of building LLM applications</summary>

In implementing popular LLM use cases – such as retrieval augmented generation, agents using internal tools & APIs, or background extraction/classification jobs – developers face a unique set of challenges that is different from traditional software engineering:

**Tracing & Control Flow**: Many valuable LLM apps rely on complex, repeated, chained or agentic calls to a foundation model. This makes debugging these applications hard as it is difficult to pinpoint the root cause of an issue in an extended control flow.

_With Langfuse_, it is simple to capture the full context of an LLM application. Our client SDKs and integrations are model and framework agnostic and able to capture the full context of an execution. Users commonly track LLM inference, embedding retrieval, API usage and any other interaction with internal systems that helps pinpoint problems. Users of frameworks such as LangChain benefit from automated instrumentation, otherwise the SDKs offer an ergonomic way to define the steps to be tracked by Langfuse.

**Output quality**: In traditional software engineering, developers are used to testing for the absence of exceptions and compliance with test cases. LLM-based applications are non-deterministic and there rarely is a hard-and-fast standard to assess quality. Understanding the quality of an application, especially at scale, and what ‘good’ evaluation looks like is a main challenge. This problem is accelerated by changes to hosted models that are outside of the user’s control.

_With Langfuse_, users can attach scores to production traces (or even sub-steps of them) to move closer to measuring quality. Depending on the use case, these can be based on model-based evaluations, user feedback, manual labeling or other e.g. implicit data signals. These metrics can then be used to monitor quality over time, by specific users, and versions/releases of the application when wanting to understand the impact of changes deployed to production.

**Mixed intent**: Many LLM apps do not tightly constrain user input. Conversational and agentic applications often contend with wildly varying inputs and user intent.
This poses a challenge: teams build and test their app with their own mental model but real world users often have different goals and lead to many surprising and unexpected results.

_With Langfuse_, users can classify inputs as part of their application and ingest this additional context to later analyze their users behavior in-depth.

## LLM Application Observability

Instrument your app and start ingesting traces to Langfuse, thereby tracking LLM calls and other relevant logic in your app such as retrieval, embedding, or agent actions. Inspect and debug complex logs and user sessions.

[Learn more](/docs/tracing) about tracing in Langfuse or play with the [interactive demo](/docs/demo).

<details>
<summary>Key benefits</summary>
  
- **Full context:** Capture the complete execution flow including API calls, context, prompts, parallelism and more
- **Conversation/session view:** In multi-turn conversations, group interactions into sessions
- **User tracking:** Add your own identifiers to inspect traces from specific users
- **Cost tracking:** Monitor model usage and costs across your application
- **Quality insights:** Collect user feedback and identify low-quality outputs
- **Low overhead:** Designed for production with minimal performance impact
- **Best-in-class SDKs:** We offer best-in-class SDKs for Python, JS/TS for easy integration
- **Framework support:** Integrated with popular frameworks like OpenAI SDK, LangChain, and LlamaIndex
- **Multi-modal:** Support for tracing text, images and other modalities
- **Open source:** Fully open source with public API for custom integrations

## Prompt Management

[Langfuse Prompt Management](/docs/prompts) helps you centrally manage, version control, and collaboratively iterate on your prompts.

<details>
<summary>Key benefits</summary>

- **Decoupled from code:** Deploy new prompts without application redeployment
- **Version control:** Track changes and quickly rollback when needed
- **Performance optimized:** Client-side caching prevents latency or availability issues
- **Multi-format support:** Works with both text and chat prompts
- **Flexible access:** Edit via UI, SDKs, or API
- **Non-technical friendly:** Business users can update prompts via Console

## Evaluations

[Evaluations](/docs/scores) are the most important part of the LLM Application development workflow. Langfuse adapts to your needs and supports:

- **LLM-as-a-judge:** Fully managed evaluators run on production or development traces within Langfuse
- **User feedback:** Collect feedback from your users and add it to traces in Langfuse
- **Manual labeling:** Annotate traces with human feedback in managed workflows
- **Custom:** Build your own evaluation pipelines via Langfuse APIs/SDKs for full flexibility

import EvaluationOverview from "@/components-mdx/evaluation-overview-gifs.mdx";

## Datasets

Via [Langfuse Datasets](/docs/datasets) you can create test sets and benchmarks to evaluate the performance of your LLM application.

- **Continuous improvement:** Create datasets from production edge cases to improve your application
- **Pre-deployment testing:** Benchmark new releases before deploying to production
- **Structured testing:** Run experiments on collections of inputs and expected outputs
- **Flexible evaluation:** Add custom evaluation metrics or use llm-as-a-judge
- **Integration ready:** Works with popular frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex

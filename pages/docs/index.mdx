# Introduction

`langfuse` is an open-source logging and feedback solution tailor-made for working with LLMs. By logging all user interactions as well as explicit and implicit user feedback, you can analyze, debug and ultimately improve your LLM-based application.

## Features

1. Data collection via SDKs
   - Tracing LLM chains by collecting specific data such as prompts, outputs, and configurations
   - Feedback collection from users
     - Explicit, e.g., thumbs up/down, star rating
     - Implicit, e.g., user copied the completion, user clicked on a link, user did not edit before submitting the suggested text
1. Data exploration
   - Segment traces based on user feedback to identify issues
   - Debugging: find the root cause of issues by exploring traces and feedback
1. Store high-quality prompt/completion pairs (positive feedback)
   - Use them in few-shot prompts
   - Use them for fine-tuning

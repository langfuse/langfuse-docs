# Introduction

Langfuse is an **open source product analytics suite for LLM apps**.

## Features

1. [Integrations](/docs/integrations): Data collection via SDKs
   - Tracing LLM chains by collecting specific data such as prompts, outputs, and configurations
   - Measure quality of outputs via [Scores](/docs/scores)
   - Feedback collection from users
     - Explicit, e.g., thumbs up/down, star rating
     - Implicit, e.g., user copied the completion, user clicked on a link, user did not edit before submitting the suggested text
1. [Nested traces](/docs/tracing)
   - Find the root cause of issues
   - Segment traces based on user feedback and other metrics
1. Analytics
   - [User-level reporting](/docs/user-explorer): costs, usage, feedback/quality
   - [Usage/cost](/docs/token-usage)
   - More to come soon! (get [early access](/docs/analytics))

## Why Langfuse?

- [Open source](/docs/open-source) (MIT license)
- Run Langfuse [self-hosted](/docs/deployment/self-host), [locally](/docs/deployment/local), or use [Langfuse cloud](/docs/deployment/cloud)
- Model agnostic
- Integration
  - [Public API](/docs/integrations/api)
  - Fully async SDKs for:
    - [JS/TS (Node, Edge)](/docs/integrations/sdk/typescript)
    - [Python](/docs/integrations/sdk/python)
  - [Langchain integration](/docs/integrations/langchain) (full integration in 5 minutes)
  - Report user feedback and other metrics from the front-end via [JS/TS Web SDK](/docs/integrations/sdk/typescript-web)
  - Incrementally adoptable, start with a single LLM call, expand to full tracing of complex chains/agents
- Use [GET API](/docs/integrations/api) to build downstream use cases

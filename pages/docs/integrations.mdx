# Integrations

To explore production traces and metrics in Langfuse, you need to integrate your application with Langfuse.

Objective:

1. Capture [traces](/docs/tracing) of your application
2. Add [scores](/docs/scores) to these traces to measure/evaluate quality of outputs

There are currently four main ways to integrate with Langfuse:

| Integration                  | Supports      | Description                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Langchain](/docs/langchain) | JS/TS, Python | Automated instrumentation by passing callback handler to Langchain application. |
| [SDK](/docs/sdk)             | JS/TS, Python | Manual instrumentation using the SDKs for full flexibility.                     |
| [OpenAI](/docs/openai)       | Python        | Automated instrumentation using drop-in replacement of OpenAI SDK.              |
| [API](/docs/api)             |               | Directly call the public API. OpenAPI spec available.                           |

In addition, Langfuse is natively integrated with the following projects/packages:

| Name                       | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Flowise](/docs/flowise)   | JS/TS no-code builder for customized LLM flows.                                                                                                  |
| [Langflow](/docs/langflow) | Python-based UI for LangChain, designed with react-flow to provide an effortless way to experiment and prototype flows.                          |
| [LiteLLM](/docs/litellm)   | Use any LLM as a drop in replacement for GPT. Use Azure, OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic, Ollama, VLLM, Sagemaker, HuggingFace, Replicate (100+ LLMs). |

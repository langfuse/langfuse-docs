# Integrations

To explore production traces and metrics in Langfuse, you need to integrate your application with Langfuse.

Objective:

1. Capture [traces](/docs/tracing) of your application
2. Add [scores](/docs/scores) to these traces to measure/evaluate quality of outputs

There are currently three ways to integrate with Langfuse:

| Integration                                           | Tracing                                                               | Scores               |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| [Langchain integration](/docs/integrations/langchain) | Yes, with fully automated instrumentation                             | No, use SDKs         |
| [SDKs for JS/TS and Python](/docs/integrations/sdk)   | Yes, incrementally adoptable and abstractions to create nested traces | Yes                  |
| [API](/docs/integrations/api)                         | Yes, ingest manually                                                  | Yes, ingest manually |

# Integrations

To explore production traces and metrics in Langfuse, you need to integrate your application with Langfuse.

Objective:

1. Capture [traces](/docs/tracing) of your application
2. Add [scores](/docs/scores) to these traces to measure/evaluate quality of outputs

There are currently three main ways to integrate with Langfuse:

| Integration                                           | Tracing                                                               | Scores               |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| [Langchain integration](/docs/integrations/langchain) | Yes, with fully automated instrumentation                             | No, use SDKs         |
| [SDKs for JS/TS and Python](/docs/integrations/sdk)   | Yes, incrementally adoptable and abstractions to create nested traces | Yes                  |
| [API](/docs/integrations/api)                         | Yes, ingest manually                                                  | Yes, ingest manually |

In addition, Langfuse is natively integrated with the following projects:

| Name                                    | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Flowise](/docs/integrations/flowise)   | JS/TS no-code builder for customized LLM flows                                                                                                   |
| [Langflow](/docs/integrations/langflow) | Python-based UI for LangChain, designed with react-flow to provide an effortless way to experiment and prototype flows.                          |
| [LiteLLM](/docs/integrations/litellm)   | Use any LLM as a drop in replacement for GPT. Use Azure, OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic, Ollama, VLLM, Sagemaker, HuggingFace, Replicate (100+ LLMs). |

Unsure which integration to choose? Ask us on [Discord](/discord) or in the chat.

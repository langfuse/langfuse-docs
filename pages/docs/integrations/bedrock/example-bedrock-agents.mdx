# Trace Bedrock Agents with Langfuse

> **What are Amazon Bedrock Agents?**
> [Amazon Bedrock Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/) are managed services that simplify the creation and deployment of AI-powered conversational agents capable of executing tasks and retrieving information by integrating foundation models with external data sources and APIs.

> **What is Langfuse?**
> [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) is an open-source platform for LLM engineering. It provides tracing and monitoring capabilities for AI agents, helping developers debug, analyze, and optimize their products. Langfuse integrates with various tools and frameworks via native integrations, OpenTelemetry, and SDKs.

## Get Started

This cookbook implements an OpenTelemetry-based tracing and monitoring system for [Amazon Bedrock Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/) through [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) integration.

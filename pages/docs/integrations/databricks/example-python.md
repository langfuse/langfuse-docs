# Observability for Databricks Models with Langfuse

Databricks provides a powerful platform for hosting and serving large language models. By combining Databricks' serving endpoints with **Langfuse**, you can trace, monitor, and analyze your AI workloads in development and production.

This notebook demonstrates **three** different ways to use Databricks models with Langfuse:
1. **OpenAI SDK:** Use Databricks model endpoints via the OpenAI SDK.
2. **LangChain:** Integrate with the Databricks LLM interface in a LangChain pipeline.
3. **LlamaIndex:** Use Databricks endpoints within LlamaIndex.

> **What is Databricks Model Serving?**  
Databricks Model Serving allows you to serve large-scale models in a production environment, with automatic scaling and a robust infrastructure. It also enables you to fine-tune LLMs on your private data, ensuring your models can leverage proprietary information while maintaining data privacy.

> **What is Langfuse?**  
[Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is an open source platform for LLM observability and monitoring. It helps you trace and monitor your AI applications by capturing metadata, prompt details, token usage, latency, and more.


## 1. Install Dependencies

Before you begin, install the necessary packages in your Python environment:

- **openai**: Needed to call Databricks endpoints via the OpenAI SDK.
- **databricks-langchain**: Needed to call Databricks endpoints via an "OpenAI-like" interface.
- **llama-index** and **llama-index-llms-databricks**: For using Databricks endpoints within LlamaIndex.
- **langfuse**: Required for sending trace data to the Langfuse platform.



```python
%pip install openai langfuse databricks-langchain llama-index llama-index-llms-databricks
```

## 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Configure your **Langfuse** credentials and **Databricks** credentials as environment variables. Replace the dummy keys below with the real ones from your respective accounts.

 - `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` / `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`: From your Langfuse Project Settings.
 - `LANGFUSE_HOST`: `https://cloud.langfuse.com` (EU region) or `https://us.cloud.langfuse.com` (US region).
 - `DATABRICKS_TOKEN`: Your Databricks personal access token.
 - `DATABRICKS_HOST`: Your Databricks workspace URL (e.g., `https://dbc-xxxxxxx.cloud.databricks.com`).



```python
import os

# Example environment variables (replace with your actual keys/tokens)
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..."  # your public key
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..."  # your secret key
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com"  # or https://us.cloud.langfuse.com

os.environ["DATABRICKS_TOKEN"] = "dapi-..."  # Databricks personal access token
os.environ["DATABRICKS_HOST"] = "https://dbc-XXXXX-XXXX.cloud.databricks.com"
```

## Approach 1: Using Databricks Models via the OpenAI SDK

Databricks endpoints can act as a drop-in replacement for the OpenAI API. This makes it easy to integrate with existing code that relies on the `openai` library. Under the hood, `langfuse.openai.OpenAI` automatically traces your requests to Langfuse.

### Steps
1. Import the `OpenAI` client from `langfuse.openai`.
2. Create a client, setting `api_key` to your Databricks token and `base_url` to your Databricks workspace endpoints.
3. Use the clientâ€™s `chat.completions.create()` method to send a prompt.
4. See the trace in your Langfuse dashboard.

**Note:** For more examples on tracing OpenAI with Langfuse see the [OpenAI integration docs](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/openai/python/get-started).


```python
# Langfuse OpenAI client
from langfuse.openai import OpenAI

# Retrieve the environment variables
databricks_token = os.environ.get("DATABRICKS_TOKEN")
databricks_host = os.environ.get("DATABRICKS_HOST")

# Create an OpenAI-like client pointing to Databricks
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=databricks_token,  # Databricks personal access token
    base_url=f"{databricks_host}/serving-endpoints",  # your Databricks workspace
)
```


```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is Databricks?"}
    ],
    model="mistral-7b", # Adjust based on your Databricks serving endpoint name
    max_tokens=256
)

# Print out the response from the model
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

    1. Databricks is a cloud-based data engineering and analytics platform that enables users to build, deploy, and run data science workloads at scale.
    2. It includes a streaming data processing engine called Spark Streaming that is often used in real-time analytics and big data processing applications, as well as a data warehousing platform called Delta Lake that allows users to store and query large amounts of data.
    3. Databricks is based on the open-source Apache Spark and LakeFormation libraries and was founded in 2013 by the original developers of Spark.
    4. It is often used in combination with other big data technologies, such as Hadoop, NoSQL databases, and data visualization tools, to help organizations manage and analyze large volumes of data.
    5. It also includes machine learning libraries, like "MLlib" and "MLflow" which enable to build, train, and deploy machine learning models directly on the cluster.


Once the request completes, **log in to your Langfuse dashboard** and look for the new trace. You will see details like the prompt, response, latency, token usage, etc.

## Approach 2: Using LangChain

Databricks models can also be used via LangChain. The [`ChatDatabricks`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/databricks/) class wraps your Databricks Model Serving endpoint.

### Steps
1. Set `DATABRICKS_HOST` as an environment variable.
2. Initialize a Langfuse `CallbackHandler` that automatically collects trace data.
3. Use `ChatDatabricks` with your endpoint name, temperature, or other parameters.
4. Invoke the model with messages and pass in the Langfuse callback handler.
5. See the trace in your Langfuse dashboard.

**Note:** For more examples on tracing LangChain with Langfuse see the [LangChain integration docs](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/langchain/tracing).


```python
from langfuse.callback import CallbackHandler

# Initialize the Langfuse callback handler
langfuse_handler = CallbackHandler(
    secret_key=os.environ.get("LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"),
    public_key=os.environ.get("LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"),
    host=os.environ.get("LANGFUSE_HOST")
)
```


```python
from databricks_langchain import ChatDatabricks

chat_model = ChatDatabricks(
    endpoint="mistral-7b",   # Your Databricks Model Serving endpoint name
    temperature=0.1,
    max_tokens=256,
    # Other parameters can be added here
)

# Build a prompt as a list of system/user messages
messages = [
    ("system", "You are a chatbot that can answer questions about Databricks."),
    ("user", "What is Databricks Model Serving?")
]

# Invoke the model using LangChain's .invoke() method
chat_model.invoke(messages, config={"callbacks": [langfuse_handler]})
```

## Approach 3: Using LlamaIndex

If you use [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index) for data ingestion, indexing, or retrieval-augmented generation, you can replace the default LLM with a Databricks endpoint.

### Steps
1. Import `Databricks` from `llama_index.llms.databricks`.
2. Initialize a `Databricks` LLM with your endpoint name and Databricks credentials.
3. Use `LlamaIndexInstrumentor` from `langfuse.llama_index` to enable automatic tracing.
4. Invoke the LLM with a chat request.
5. See the trace in your Langfuse dashboard.

**Note:** For more examples on tracing LlamaIndex with Langfuse see the [LlamaIndex integration docs](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/llama-index/get-started).



```python
from llama_index.llms.databricks import Databricks

# Create a Databricks LLM instance
llm = Databricks(
    model="mistral-7b",  # Your Databricks serving endpoint name
    api_key=os.environ.get("DATABRICKS_TOKEN"),
    api_base=f"{os.environ.get('DATABRICKS_HOST')}/serving-endpoints/"
)
```


```python
from langfuse.llama_index import LlamaIndexInstrumentor
from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage

# Initialize the LlamaIndexInstrumentor to trace LlamaIndex operations
instrumentor = LlamaIndexInstrumentor(
    secret_key=os.environ.get("LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"),
    public_key=os.environ.get("LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"),
    host=os.environ.get("LANGFUSE_HOST")
)

# Start automatic tracing
instrumentor.start()
```


```python
messages = [
    ChatMessage(role="system", content="You are a helpful assistant."),
    ChatMessage(role="user", content="What is Databricks?")
]

response = llm.chat(messages)
print(response)

# Flush any pending events to Langfuse
instrumentor.flush()
```

# DSPy - Observability & Tracing

This cookbook demonstrates how to use DSPy with Langfuse. 

> **What is DSPy?** [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) is a framework that systematically optimizes language model prompts and weights, making it easier to build and refine complex systems with LMs by automating the tuning process and improving reliability. For further information on DSPy, please visit the [documentation](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/docs/intro).

> **What is Langfuse?** [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is an open-source LLM engineering platform. It offers tracing and monitoring capabilities for AI applications. Langfuse helps developers debug, analyze, and optimize their AI systems by providing detailed insights and integrating with a wide array of tools and frameworks through native integrations, OpenTelemetry, and dedicated SDKs.

## Prerequisites
Install the latest versions of DSPy and langfuse. 


```python
%pip install langfuse dspy openinference-instrumentation-dspy -U
```

## Step 1: Setup Langfuse Environment Variables

First, we configure the environment variables. We set the OpenTelemetry endpoint, protocol, and authorization headers so that the traces from DSPy are correctly sent to Langfuse. You can get your Langfuse API keys by signing up for [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com) or [self-hosting Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting).


```python
import os

# Get keys for your project from the project settings page: https://cloud.langfuse.com
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇪🇺 EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇺🇸 US region

# Your OpenAI key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-proj-..." 
```

With the environment variables set, we can now initialize the Langfuse client. `get_client()` initializes the Langfuse client using the credentials provided in the environment variables.


```python
from langfuse import get_client
 
langfuse = get_client()
 
# Verify connection
if langfuse.auth_check():
    print("Langfuse client is authenticated and ready!")
else:
    print("Authentication failed. Please check your credentials and host.")

```

## Step 2: Enable Tracing for DSPy

Next, we use the [OpenInference Instrumentation](https://pypi.org/project/openinference-instrumentation-dspy/) module for DSPy to automatically capture your DSPy traces. This is done by a single call which instruments DSPy’s LM calls.


```python
from openinference.instrumentation.dspy import DSPyInstrumentor

DSPyInstrumentor().instrument()
```

## Step 3: Configure DSPy

Next, we set up DSPy. This involves initializing a language model and configuring DSPy to use it. You can then run various DSPy modules that showcase its features.


```python
import dspy
lm = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini')
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
```

## Step 4: Running DSPy Modules with Observability

Here are a few examples from the [DSPy documentation](https://dspy.ai/) showing core features. Each example automatically sends trace data to Langfuse.

### Example 1: Using the Chain-of-Thought Module (Math Reasoning)


```python
math = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer: float")
math(question="Two dice are tossed. What is the probability that the sum equals two?")
```

### Example 2: Building a RAG Pipeline


```python
def search_wikipedia(query: str) -> list[str]:
    results = dspy.ColBERTv2(url='http://20.102.90.50:2017/wiki17_abstracts')(query, k=3)
    return [x['text'] for x in results]

rag = dspy.ChainOfThought('context, question -> response')

question = "What's the name of the castle that David Gregory inherited?"
rag(context=search_wikipedia(question), question=question)
```

### Example 3: Running a Classification Module with DSPy Signatures


```python
def evaluate_math(expression: str):
    return dspy.PythonInterpreter({}).execute(expression)

def search_wikipedia(query: str):
    results = dspy.ColBERTv2(url='http://20.102.90.50:2017/wiki17_abstracts')(query, k=3)
    return [x['text'] for x in results]

react = dspy.ReAct("question -> answer: float", tools=[evaluate_math, search_wikipedia])

pred = react(question="What is 9362158 divided by the year of birth of David Gregory of Kinnairdy castle?")
print(pred.answer)
```

## Step 5: Viewing Traces in Langfuse

After running your DSPy application, you can inspect the traced events in Langfuse:

_[Public example trace link in Langfuse](https://cloud.langfuse.com/project/cloramnkj0002jz088vzn1ja4/traces/c6182b14e8e7ac7543645e19cdf1a895?timestamp=2025-06-06T15%3A59%3A47.264Z&display=details&observation=dfec1f8a95e91773)_


## Add Additional Attributes

Langfuse allows you to pass additional attributes to your spans. These can include `user_id`, `tags`, `session_id`, and custom `metadata`. Enriching traces with these details is important for analysis, debugging, and monitoring of your application's behavior across different users or sessions.

The following code demonstrates how to start a custom span with `langfuse.start_as_current_span` and then update the trace associated with this span using `span.update_trace()`. 

**→ Learn more about [Updating Trace and Span Attributes](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python/sdk-v3#updating-observations).**


```python
with langfuse.start_as_current_span(
    name="dspy-trace",
    ) as span:
    
    # Run your application here
    question="Two dice are tossed. What is the probability that the sum equals two?"
    math = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer: float")
    result = math(question = question)
    print(result)

    # Pass additional attributes to the span
    span.update_trace(
        input=question,
        output=result,
        user_id="user_123",
        session_id="session_abc",
        tags=["dev", "dspy"],
        metadata={"email": "user@langfuse.com"},
        version="1.0.0"
        )

# Flush events in short-lived applications
langfuse.flush()
```

## Score Traces and Spans

Langfuse lets you ingest custom scores for individual spans or entire traces. This scoring workflow enables you to implement custom quality checks at runtime or facilitate human-in-the-loop evaluation processes.

In the example below, we demonstrate how to score a specific span for `relevance` (a numeric score) and the overall trace for `feedback` (a categorical score). This helps in systematically assessing and improving your application.

**→ Learn more about [Custom Scores in Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/custom).**


```python
with langfuse.start_as_current_span(
    name="dspy-scored-trace",
    ) as span:
    
    # Run your application here
    question="Two dice are tossed. What is the probability that the sum equals two?"
    math = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer: float")
    result = math(question = question)
    print(result)
    
    # Score this specific span
    span.score(name="relevance", value=0.9, data_type="NUMERIC")

    # Score the overall trace
    span.score_trace(name="feedback", value="positive", data_type="CATEGORICAL")

# Flush events in short-lived applications
langfuse.flush()
```

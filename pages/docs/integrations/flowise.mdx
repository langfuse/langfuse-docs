# Flowise Integration

**Flowise** ([GitHub](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise)) is a no-code builder. It lets you build customized LLM flows with a drag & drop editor.

With the native integration, you can use Flowise to quickly create complex LLM applications in no-code and then use Langfuse to monitor and improve them.

The integration supports all use cases of Flowise, including: interactively in the UI, API, and embeds.

## Integration

<Steps>

### Obtain Langfuse API keys

   [cloud.langfuse.com](https://cloud.langfuse.com/auth/sign-up)
2. Copy API keys for your
   project

1. Follow [instructions](/docs/get-started/) on self-hosting or local setups
2. Copy API keys for your
   project

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Run Flowise

```sh
# install
npm install -g flowise

# start
npx flowise start
```

### Add Langfuse

You can optionally add `release` to tag the current version of the flow. You usually don't need to change the other options.

## Mapping of Flowise to Langfuse

The integration automatically maps the following fields from Flowise to Langfuse:

| Flowise                                                          | Langfuse                    | Required version                                                                     |

## User Tracking

When using the Flowise Prediction API, you have the option to include a `userId` in the `overrideConfig` parameter. This allows for [user-level tracking and analysis](/docs/user-explorer) in Langfuse.

Learn more about `overrideConfig` in the [Flowise Prediction API documentation](https://docs.flowiseai.com/using-flowise/api#prediction-api).

```json
{
  "question": "hi there",
  "overrideConfig": {
    "analytics": {
      "langFuse": {
        "userId": "user1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

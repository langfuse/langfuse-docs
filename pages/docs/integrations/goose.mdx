# Integrating Goose with Langfuse

[Goose](https://github.com/block/goose) is an open-source, on-machine AI agent that automates engineering tasks seamlessly. By integrating Goose with [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com), you can monitor your Goose requests and actions using your self-hosted Langfuse instance.

This guide will walk you through the steps to integrate Goose with Langfuse.

## Prerequisites

- **docker & docker compose** -> use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) on Mac or Windows
- **Goose** installed. Instructions are available on the [Goose repository](https://github.com/block/goose).

## Steps

### 1. Run Langfuse Locally

First, set up a local instance of Langfuse.

**Clone the Langfuse Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git
cd langfuse
```

**Start the Application:**

```bash
docker compose up
```

Wait for the containers to start. Once the Langfuse server is running, you can access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

**Log In:**

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and log in using the default email and password provided in the shell output during startup. You can also find these credentials in the `.env.langfuse.local` file.

_For detailed instructions, refer to the [Langfuse Local Deployment Guide](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting/local)._

### 2. Configure Goose to Connect to Langfuse

Set the environment variables so that Goose (written in Rust) can connect to your local Langfuse server.

```bash
export LANGFUSE_INIT_PROJECT_PUBLIC_KEY=publickey-local
export LANGFUSE_INIT_PROJECT_SECRET_KEY=secretkey-local
```

These keys are the default values for a local Langfuse instance.

### 3. Run Goose with Langfuse Integration

Now, you can run Goose and monitor your AI requests and actions through Langfuse. Run Goose as you normally would. 

With Goose running and the environment variables set, Langfuse will start capturing traces of your Goose activities. You can view these traces at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

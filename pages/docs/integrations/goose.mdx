Goose is a powerful, open-source AI agent that runs locally on your machine to automate common engineering workflows. It's designed to help developers spend more time building and less time on repetitive tasks.

Core capabilities:

- Fully open source and extensible, enabling you to customize Goose for your specific needs
- Local-first architecture that keeps you in control of execution and data
- Flexible integration options with your preferred LLM providers and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers
- Built-in intelligence to handle complex engineering tasks with minimal supervision

Here are some real-world examples of how developers use Goose:

- Generate comprehensive test data that accurately reflects complex API business logic
- Build automation scripts for Google Workspace to streamline team coordination
- Execute large-scale codebase migrations, such as React component updates
- Create and manage custom CLI tools to optimize development workflows

## Get Started

This guide will walk you through the steps to integrate Goose with Langfuse.

<Steps>

### Set up Langfuse

Sign up for Langfuse Cloud [here](https://cloud.langfuse.com) or self-host Langfuse [Docker Compose](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting/local) to get your Langfuse API keys.

### Configure Goose to Connect to Langfuse

Set the environment variables so that Goose (written in Rust) can connect to the Langfuse server.

```bash
export LANGFUSE_INIT_PROJECT_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-...
export LANGFUSE_INIT_PROJECT_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...
export LANGFUSE_HOST=https://cloud.langfuse.com # EU data region ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º

# https://us.cloud.langfuse.com if you're using the US region ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
# https://localhost:3000 if you're self-hosting
```

### Run Goose with Langfuse Integration

Now, you can run Goose and monitor your AI requests and actions through Langfuse.

With Goose running and the environment variables set, Langfuse will start capturing traces of your Goose activities.

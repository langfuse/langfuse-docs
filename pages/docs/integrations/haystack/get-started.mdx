# ðŸŒ¾ Haystack Integration

This integration allows you to easily [trace](/docs/tracing) your Haystack pipelines in the Langfuse UI.

> [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) is the open-source Python framework developed by deepset. Its modular design allows users to implement custom pipelines to build production-ready LLM applications, like retrieval-augmented generative pipelines and state-of-the-art search systems. It integrates with Hugging Face Transformers, Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic and others, making it an extremely popular framework for teams of all sizes.

Thanks to the team at deepset for developing this integration (`langfuse-haystack` package). These docs are adapted from their write up, which you can read [here](https://haystack.deepset.ai/blog/langfuse-integration).

## How Can Langfuse Help?

The `langfuse-haystack` package integrates [tracing](/docs/tracing) capabilities into Haystack (2.x) pipelines using Langfuse.

This can be helpful in the following ways:

- Capture comprehensive details of the execution trace and model performance
  - Latency
  - Token usage
  - Cost
  - Scores
- Capture the full context of the execution, independently observe retrieval and summarization
- Build fine-tuning and testing datasets
- Monitor model performance
- Pinpoint areas for improvement

## Installation and Setup

<Steps>

### Install packages

Install Haystack, Langfuse and the integration package.

```bash
pip install haystack-ai langfuse-haystack langfuse
```

### Set Environment Variables

1. Langfuse: You can find your Langfuse public and private API keys in the project settings.
2. Haystack: Enable `HAYSTACK_CONTENT_TRACING_ENABLED`.

```python
import os

# Get keys for your project from the project settings page
# https://cloud.langfuse.com
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ US region

# Enable Haystack content tracing
os.environ["HAYSTACK_CONTENT_TRACING_ENABLED"] = "True"
```

</Steps>

<Callout type="info" emoji="âœ¨">
  Done! Traces and metrics from your Haystack application are now automatically
  tracked in Langfuse. Whenever you run your application, traces and metrics are
  immediately visible in the Langfuse UI.

## Example Usage

We compiled a cookbook to showcase the integration:

import { FileCode } from "lucide-react";

## Acknowledgement

We're thrilled to collaborate with the Haystack team to give the best possible experience to devs when building complex RAG applications. Thanks to them for developing this intgeration.

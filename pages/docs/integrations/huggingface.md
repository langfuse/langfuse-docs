# Cookbook: Monitor ðŸ¤— Hugging Face Models with ðŸª¢ Langfuse

This cookbook shows you how to monitor Hugging Face models using the OpenAI SDK integration with [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com). This allows you to collaboratively debug, monitor and evaluate your LLM applications.

With this integration, you can test and evaluate different models, monitor your application's cost and assign scores such as user feedback or human annotations.

**Note**: *In this example, we use the OpenAI SDK to [access the Hugging Face inference APIs](https://huggingface.co/blog/tgi-messages-api). You can also use other frameworks, such as [Langchain](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/langchain/tracing), or ingest the data via our [API](https://api.reference.langfuse.com/).*

## Setup

### Install Required Packages


```python
%pip install langfuse openai --upgrade
```

### Set Environment Variables

Set up your environment variables with the necessary keys. Get keys for your Langfuse project from [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com). Also, obtain an access token from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).



```python
import os

# Get keys for your project from https://cloud.langfuse.com
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..." # Private Project
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..." # Private Project
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com"  # ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com"  # ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ US region

os.environ["HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN"] = "hf_..."
```

### Import Necessary Modules

Instead of importing `openai` directly, import it from `langfuse.openai`. Also, import any other necessary modules.


```python
# Instead of: import openai
from langfuse.openai import OpenAI
from langfuse.decorators import observe
```

### Initialize the OpenAI Client for Hugging Face Models

Initialize the OpenAI client but point it to the Hugging Face model endpoint. You can use any model hosted on Hugging Face that supports the OpenAI API format. Replace the model URL and access token with your own.

For this example, we use the `Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct` model.


```python
# Initialize the OpenAI client, pointing it to the Hugging Face Inference API
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct" + "/v1/",  # replace with your endpoint url
    api_key= os.getenv('HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN'),  # replace with your token
)
```

## Examples

### Chat Completion Request

Use the `client` to make a chat completion request to the Hugging Face model. The `model` parameter can be any identifier since the actual model is specified in the `base_url.`


```python
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="model-name",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Write a poem about language models"
        }
    ]
)
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

    In silicon halls, where data reigns
    A marvel emerges, a linguistic brain
    A language model,365, so they claim
    Generated by code, yet learns to proclaim
    
    It digs and mines, through texts of old
    Captures nuances, young and bold
    From syntax to semantics, it makes its way
    Unraveling meaning, day by day
    
    With neural nets, it weaves its spell
    Assembling words, a story to tell
    From command to conversation, it learns to

### Observe the Request with Langfuse

By using the `OpenAI` client from `langfuse.openai`, your requests are automatically traced in Langfuse. You can also use the `@observe()` decorator to group multiple generations into a single trace.


```python
@observe()  # Decorator to automatically create a trace and nest generations
def generate_rap():
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        name="rap-generator",
        model="tgi",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a poet."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "Compose a rap about the open source LLM engineering platform Langfuse."}
        ],
        metadata={"category": "rap"},
    )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content

rap = generate_rap()
print(rap)
```

    (The rhythm is set, the beat's on fire)
    Yo, listen up, it's time to acquire
    Knowledge on Langfuse, the game is dire
    Open-source, the future is higher
    LLM engineering platform, no need to question the fire
    
    Verse 1:
    Langfuse, the brainchild of geniuses bright
    Built with passion, crafted with precision and might
    A platform so versatile, it's a beautiful sight
    For developers who dare to take flight
    They're building

### Add Additional Langfuse Features (User, Tags, Metadata, Session)

You can access additional Langfuse features by adding relevant attributes to the request. This includes setting `user_id`, `session_id`, `tags`, and `metadata`.


```python
completion_with_attributes = client.chat.completions.create(
    name="translation-with-attributes",  # Trace name
    model="tgi",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a translator."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Translate the following text from English to German: 'The Language model produces text'"}
    ],
    temperature=0.7,
    metadata={"language": "English"},  # Trace metadata
    tags=["translation", "language", "German"],  # Trace tags
    user_id="user1234",  # Trace user ID
    session_id="session5678",  # Trace session ID
)
print(completion_with_attributes.choices[0].message.content)
```

    The translation of the text from English to German is:
    
    "Das Sprachmodell produziert Text"

# Instructor - Observability & Tracing

[Instructor](https://python.useinstructor.com/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor/)) is a popular library to get structured LLM outputs.

> Instructor makes it easy to reliably get structured data like JSON from Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4-Vision, including open source models like Mistral/Mixtral from Together, Anyscale, Ollama, and llama-cpp-python. By leveraging various modes like Function Calling, Tool Calling and even constrained sampling modes like JSON mode, JSON Schema; Instructor stands out for its simplicity, transparency, and user-centric design. Under the hood, Instructor leverages Pydantic to do the heavy lifting, and provides a simple, easy-to-use API on top of it by helping you manage validation context, retries with Tenacity, and streaming Lists and Partial responses.

This is a cookbook with examples of the Langfuse Integration for Python.

## Setup


```python
%pip install langfuse openai pydantic instructor --upgrade
```

Initialize the Langfuse client with your API keys from the project settings in the Langfuse UI and add them to your environment.


```python
import os

# get keys for your project from https://cloud.langfuse.com
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = ""
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = ""

# your openai key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""
```

## Get started

It is easy to use instructor with Langfuse. We use the [Langfuse OpenAI intgeration](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/openai) and simply patch the client with instructor. This works with both synchronous and asynchronous clients.

### Langfuse-Instructor integration with sychnronous OpenAI client


```python
import instructor
from langfuse.openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Patch Langfuse wrapper of synchronous OpenAI client with instructor
client = instructor.patch(OpenAI())

class WeatherDetail(BaseModel):
    city: str
    temperature: int

# Run synchronous OpenAI client
weather_info = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    response_model=WeatherDetail,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "The weather in Paris is 18 degrees Celsius."},
    ],
)

print(weather_info.model_dump_json(indent=2))
"""
{
  "city": "Paris",
  "temperature": 18
}
"""
```

### Langfuse-Instructor integration with asychnronous OpenAI client


```python
import instructor
from langfuse.openai import AsyncOpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Patch Langfuse wrapper of synchronous OpenAI client with instructor
client = instructor.apatch(AsyncOpenAI())

class WeatherDetail(BaseModel):
    city: str
    temperature: int

# Run asynchronous OpenAI client
task = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    response_model=WeatherDetail,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "The weather in Paris is 18 degrees Celsius."},
    ],
)

response = await task
print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
"""
{
  "city": "Paris",
  "temperature": 18
}
"""
```

## Example

In this example, we first classify customer feedback into categories like `PRAISE`, `SUGGESTION`, `BUG` and `QUESTION`, and further scores the relvance of each feedback to the business on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0. In this case, we use the asynchronous OpenAI client `AsyncOpenAI` to classify and evaluate the feedback.

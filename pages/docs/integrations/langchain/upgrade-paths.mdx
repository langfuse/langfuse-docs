# Upgrade Paths: Langchain Integration

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info">
  This doc is a collection of upgrade paths for different versions of the
  integration. If you want to add the integration to your project, you should start with the latest version and follow the [integration guide](/docs/integrations/langchain/tracing).

</Callout>

Lanfuse and Langchain are under active development. Thus, we are constantly improving the intgration. This means that we sometimes need to make breaking changes to our APIs or need to react to breaking changes in Langchain. We try to keep these to a minimum and to provide clear upgrade paths when we do make them.

## Python [#python]

### From v2.x.x to v3.x.x 

Python SDK v3 introduces a completely revised Langfuse core with a new **observability API**. While the LangChain integration still relies on a `CallbackHandler`, nearly all ergonomics have changed. The table below highlights the most important breaking changes:

| Topic | v2 | v3 |
|-------|-----|-----|
|Package import |`from langfuse.callback import CallbackHandler`|`from langfuse.langchain import CallbackHandler`|
|Client handling | Multiple instantiated clients | Singleton pattern, access via `get_client()` |
|Trace/Span context | `CallbackHandler` optionally accepted `root` to group runs | Use context managers `with langfuse.start_as_current_span(...)` |
|Dynamic trace attrs | Pass via LangChain `config` (e.g. `metadata["langfuse_user_id"]`) | Call `span.update_trace(user_id=...)` |
|Constructor args | `CallbackHandler(sample_rate=..., user_id=...)` | No constructor args – use Langfuse client or spans |

Minimal migration example:

```python title="v2 → v3 Migration"
# Install latest SDK (>=3.0.0)
pip install --upgrade langfuse

# v2 Code (for reference)
# from langfuse.callback import CallbackHandler
# handler = CallbackHandler()
# chain.invoke({"topic": "cats"}, config={"callbacks": [handler]})

# v3 Code
from langfuse import Langfuse, get_client
from langfuse.langchain  import CallbackHandler
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

# 1. Create/Configure Langfuse client (once at startup)
Langfuse(
    public_key="your-public-key",
    secret_key="your-secret-key",
)

# 2. Access singleton instance and create handler
langfuse = get_client()
handler = CallbackHandler()

# 3. Wrap LangChain execution in a span to attach metadata
with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="tell-joke") as span:
    span.update_trace(user_id="user_123", input={"topic": "cats"})

    llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4o")
    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("Tell me a joke about {topic}")
    chain = prompt | llm

    response = chain.invoke({"topic": "cats"}, config={"callbacks": [handler]})
    span.update_trace(output={"joke": response.content})

# (Optional) Flush events in short-lived scripts
langfuse.flush()
```

- All arguments such as `sample_rate` or `tracing_enabled` must now be provided when constructing the **Langfuse** client (or via environment variables) – not on the handler.
- Functions like `flush()` and `shutdown()` moved to the client instance (`get_client().flush()`).

### From v1.x.x to v2.x.x [#python2]

The `CallbackHandler` can be used in multiple invocations of a Langchain chain as shown below.

```python
from langfuse.callback import CallbackHandler
langfuse_handler = CallbackHandler(PUBLIC_KEY, SECRET_KEY)

# Setup Langchain
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
...
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, callbacks=[langfuse_handler])

# Add Langfuse handler as callback
chain.run(input="<first_user_input>", callbacks=[langfuse_handler])
chain.run(input="<second_user_input>", callbacks=[langfuse_handler])

```

So far, invoking the chain multiple times would group the observations in one trace.

```bash
TRACE
|
|-- SPAN: Retrieval
|   |
|   |-- SPAN: LLM Chain
|   |   |
|   |   |-- GENERATION: ChatOpenAi
|-- SPAN: Retrieval
|   |
|   |-- SPAN: LLM Chain
|   |   |
|   |   |-- GENERATION: ChatOpenAi
```

We changed this, so that each invocation will end up on its own trace. This allows us to derive the user inputs and outputs to Langchain applications.

```bash
TRACE_1
|
|-- SPAN: Retrieval
|   |
|   |-- SPAN: LLM Chain
|   |   |
|   |   |-- GENERATION: ChatOpenAi

TRACE_2
|
|-- SPAN: Retrieval
|   |
|   |-- SPAN: LLM Chain
|   |   |
|   |   |-- GENERATION: ChatOpenAi
```

If you still want to group multiple invocations on one trace, you can use the Langfuse SDK combined with the Langchain integration ([more details](/docs/integrations/langchain/tracing)).

```python
from langfuse import Langfuse
langfuse = Langfuse()

# Get Langchain handler for a trace
trace = langfuse.trace()
langfuse_handler = trace.get_langchain_handler()

# langfuse_handler will use the trace for all invocations
```

## JS/TS [#js]

### From v2.x.x to v3.x.x [#js3]

Requires [`langchain ^0.1.10`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/releases/tag/0.1.10). Langchain released a new stable version of the Callback Handler interface and this version of the Langfuse SDK implements it. Older versions are no longer supported.

### From v1.x.x to v2.x.x [#js2]

The `CallbackHandler` can be used in multiple invocations of a Langchain chain as shown below.

```ts
import { CallbackHandler } from "langfuse-langchain";

// create a handler
const langfuseHandler = new CallbackHandler({
  publicKey: LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY,
  secretKey: LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY,
});

import { LLMChain } from "langchain/chains";

// create a chain
const chain = new LLMChain({
  llm: model,
  prompt,
  callbacks: [langfuseHandler],
});

// execute the chain
await chain.call(
  { product: "<user_input_one>" },
  { callbacks: [langfuseHandler] }
);
await chain.call(
  { product: "<user_input_two>" },
  { callbacks: [langfuseHandler] }
);
```

So far, invoking the chain multiple times would group the observations in one trace.

```bash
TRACE
|
|-- SPAN: Retrieval
|   |
|   |-- SPAN: LLM Chain
|   |   |
|   |   |-- GENERATION: ChatOpenAi
|-- SPAN: Retrieval
|   |
|   |-- SPAN: LLM Chain
|   |   |
|   |   |-- GENERATION: ChatOpenAi
```

We changed this, so that each invocation will end up on its own trace. This is a more sensible default setting for most users.

```bash
TRACE_1
|
|-- SPAN: Retrieval
|   |
|   |-- SPAN: LLM Chain
|   |   |
|   |   |-- GENERATION: ChatOpenAi

TRACE_2
|
|-- SPAN: Retrieval
|   |
|   |-- SPAN: LLM Chain
|   |   |
|   |   |-- GENERATION: ChatOpenAi
```

If you still want to group multiple invocations on one trace, you can use the Langfuse SDK combined with the Langchain integration ([more details](/docs/integrations/langchain/tracing)).

```ts
const trace = langfuse.trace({ id: "special-id" });
// CallbackHandler will use the trace with the id "special-id" for all invocations
const langfuseHandler = new CallbackHandler({ root: trace });
```

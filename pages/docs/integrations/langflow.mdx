# ⛓️ Langflow Integration

**Langflow** ([GitHub](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow)) is a UI for LangChain, designed with react-flow to provide an effortless way to experiment and prototype flows.

With the native integration, you can use Langflow to quickly create complex LLM applications in no-code and then use Langfuse to monitor and improve them.

Follow these steps to integrate Langflow with Langfuse:

### 1. Obtain Langfuse API keys

1. Create account and project on
   [cloud.langfuse.com](https://cloud.langfuse.com/auth/sign-up)
2. Copy API keys for your
   project

1. Follow [instructions](/docs/get-started/) on self-hosting or local setups
2. Copy API keys for your
   project

</Tab>
</Tabs>
### 2. Setup Langflow

<Tabs items={["pip install langflow", "Docker"]}>
<Tab>

```sh
# API keys from project settings in Langfuse
export LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=secret_key
export LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=public_key

# Optionally, set the host, defaults to Langfuse Cloud
# LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_HOST=http://localhost:3000

# Install Langflow
pip install langflow

# Run Langflow
langflow run
```

Alternatively, you can run the Langflow CLI command with the environment variables set:

```
LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=secret_key LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=public_key langflow
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

Clone the [Langflow repository](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow.git
cd langflow
```

Add the environment variables to `docker_example/docker-compose.yml`

```diff
version: '3'

services:
  langflow:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "7860:7860"
    environment:
+     - LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=secret_key
+     - LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=public_key
    command: langflow run --host 0.0.0.0
```

Run Langflow

```sh
cd docker_example
docker-compose up --build
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### 3. Monitor in Langfuse

Now, whenever you use Langflow's chat or API, you will be able to see the tracing of your conversations in Langfuse.

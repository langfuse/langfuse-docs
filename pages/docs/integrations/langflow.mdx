# ðŸš… Langflow

About [Langflow](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow)

> Use any LLM as a drop in replacement for GPT. Use Azure, OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic, Ollama, VLLM, Sagemaker, HuggingFace, Replicate (100+ LLMs)

## Integration

1. You'll need to export two environment variables: LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY and LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY.

```sh
# API keys from project settings in Langfuse
export LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=<your secret key>
export LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=<your public key>

```

Alternatively, you can run the Langflow CLI command:

```sh
LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=<your secret key> LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=<your public key> langflow
```

If you are self-hosting Langfuse, you can also set the environment variable LANGFLOW_LANGFUSE_HOST to point to your Langfuse instance. By default, Langfuse points to the cloud instance at https://cloud.langfuse.com.

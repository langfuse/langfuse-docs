# Integrate Langfuse with LlamaIndex

This notebook provides a step-by-step guide on integrating **Langfuse** with **LlamaIndex** to achieve observability and debugging for your LLM applications.

> **What is LlamaIndex?** [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index)) is an advanced "data framework" tailored for augmenting LLMs with private data. It streamlines the integration of diverse data sources and formats (APIs, PDFs, docs, SQL, etc.) through versatile data connectors and structures data into indices and graphs for LLM compatibility. The platform offers a sophisticated retrieval/query interface for enriching LLM inputs with context-specific outputs.

> **What is Langfuse?** [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is a an open-source LLM engineering platform. It offers tracing and monitoring capabilities for AI applications. Langfuse helps developers debug, analyze, and optimize their AI systems by providing detailed insights and integrating with a wide array of tools and frameworks through native integrations, OpenTelemetry, and dedicated SDKs.

## Getting Started

Let's walk through a practical example of using LlamaIndex and integrating it with Langfuse for comprehensive tracing.

<Steps>
### Step 1: Install Dependencies

<Callout type="info" emoji="⚠️">
_**Note:** This notebook utilizes the Langfuse OTel Python SDK v3. For users of Python SDK v2, please refer to our [legacy LlamaIndex integration guide](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/llama-index/deprecated/get-started)._
</Callout>



```python
%pip install langfuse openinference-instrumentation-llama-index llama-index-llms-openai llama-index -U

```

### Step 2: Configure Langfuse SDK

Next, set up your Langfuse API keys. You can get these keys by signing up for a free [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com/) account or by [self-hosting Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting). These environment variables are essential for the Langfuse client to authenticate and send data to your Langfuse project.



```python
import os

# Get keys for your project from the project settings page: https://cloud.langfuse.com

os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇪🇺 EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇺🇸 US region

# Your OpenAI key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-proj-..."

```

With the environment variables set, we can now initialize the Langfuse client. `get_client()` initializes the Langfuse client using the credentials provided in the environment variables.



```python
from langfuse import get_client
 
langfuse = get_client()
 
# Verify connection
if langfuse.auth_check():
    print("Langfuse client is authenticated and ready!")
else:
    print("Authentication failed. Please check your credentials and host.")

```

### Step 3: Initialize LlamaIndex Instrumentation

Now, we initialize the [OpenInference LlamaIndex instrumentation](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/tracing/integrations-tracing/llamaindex). This third-party instrumentation automatically captures LlamaIndex operations and exports OpenTelemetry (OTel) spans to Langfuse.


```python
from openinference.instrumentation.llama_index import LlamaIndexInstrumentor

# Initialize LlamaIndex instrumentation
LlamaIndexInstrumentor().instrument()
```

### Step 4: Basic LlamaIndex Application

Let's create a straightforward LlamaIndex application. In this example, we'll create a simple query engine that can answer questions. This will serve as the foundation for demonstrating Langfuse tracing.



```python
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
 
with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="llama-index-trace"):
    response = llm.complete("Hello, world!")
    print(response)
 
langfuse.flush()
```

### Step 5: View Traces in Langfuse

After executing the application, navigate to your Langfuse Trace Table. You will find detailed traces of the application's execution, providing insights into the LLM calls, retrieval operations, inputs, outputs, and performance metrics. The trace will show the complete flow from query processing through document retrieval to response generation.

![Example Trace in Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/images/cookbook/integration_llama-index/llama-index-example-trace.png)

[Example Trace in Langfuse](https://cloud.langfuse.com/project/cloramnkj0002jz088vzn1ja4/traces/12ea412956f99347b0503c1144acd0ec?timestamp=2025-06-05T15:45:52.971Z&display=details)
</Steps>

## Add Additional Attributes

Langfuse allows you to pass additional attributes to your spans. These can include `user_id`, `tags`, `session_id`, and custom `metadata`. Enriching traces with these details is important for analysis, debugging, and monitoring of your application's behavior across different users or sessions.

The following code demonstrates how to start a custom span with `langfuse.start_as_current_span` and then update the trace associated with this span using `span.update_trace()`. 

**→ Learn more about [Updating Trace and Span Attributes](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python/sdk-v3#updating-observations).**



```python
with langfuse.start_as_current_span(
    name="llama-index-trace",
    ) as span:
    
    # Run your application here
    question = "What is Langfuse?"
    response = llm.complete(question)
    print(response)

    # Pass additional attributes to the span
    span.update_trace(
        input=question,
        output=response.text,
        user_id="user_123",
        session_id="session_abc",
        tags=["rag", "llama-index"],
        metadata={"email": "user@langfuse.com"},
        version="1.0.0"
        )

# Flush events in short-lived applications
langfuse.flush()

```

## Score Traces and Spans

Langfuse lets you can ingest custom scores for individual spans or entire traces. This scoring workflow enables you to implement custom quality checks at runtime or facilitate human-in-the-loop evaluation processes.

In the example below, we demonstrate how to score a specific span for `relevance` (a numeric score) and the overall trace for `feedback` (a categorical score). This helps in systematically assessing and improving your application.

**→ Learn more about [Custom Scores in Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/custom).**



```python
with langfuse.start_as_current_span(
    name="llama-index-trace",
    ) as span:
    
    # Run your application here
    question = "What is Langfuse?"
    response = llm.complete(question)
    print(response)
    
    # Score this specific span
    span.score(name="relevance", value=0.9, data_type="NUMERIC")

    # Score the overall trace
    span.score_trace(name="feedback", value="positive", data_type="CATEGORICAL")

# Flush events in short-lived applications
langfuse.flush()

```

## Manage Prompts with Langfuse

Langfuse Prompt Management allows you to collaboratively create, version, and deploy prompts. You can manage prompts either through the Langfuse SDK or directly within the Langfuse UI. These managed prompts can then be fetched into your application at runtime.

The code below illustrates fetching a prompt named `answer-question` from Langfuse, compiling it with an input variable (`country`), and then using this compiled prompt in the application. 

**→ Get started with [Langfuse Prompt Management](https://langfuse.com/docs/prompts/get-started).**



```python
# Fetch the prompt from langfuse
langfuse_prompt = langfuse.get_prompt(name="answer-question")

# Compile the prompt with the input
compiled_prompt = langfuse_prompt.compile(country = "France")

# Run your application
with langfuse.start_as_current_span(
    name="llama-index-trace",
    ) as span:
    
    # Run your application here
    response = llm.complete(compiled_prompt)
    print(response)

# Flush events in short-lived applications
langfuse.flush()

```

## Dataset Experiments

Offline evaluation using datasets is a critical part of the LLM development lifecycle. Langfuse supports this through Dataset Experiments. The typical workflow involves:

1.  **Benchmark Dataset**: Defining a dataset with input prompts and their corresponding expected outputs.
2.  **Application Run**: Running your LLM application against each item in the dataset.
3.  **Evaluation**: Comparing the generated outputs against the expected results or using other scoring mechanisms (e.g., model-based evaluation) to assess performance.

The following example demonstrates how to use a pre-existing dataset containing countries and their capitals to run an experiment.

**→ Learn more about [Langfuse Dataset Experiments](https://langfuse.com/docs/datasets/overview).**



```python
from langfuse import get_client
 
langfuse = get_client()
 
# Fetch an existing dataset
dataset = langfuse.get_dataset(name="capital_cities_11")
for item in dataset.items:
    print(f"Input: {item.input['country']}, Expected Output: {item.expected_output}")

```
Next, we iterate through each item in the dataset, run our LlamaIndex application (`your_application`) with the item's input, and log the results as a run associated with that dataset item in Langfuse. This allows for structured evaluation and comparison of different application versions or prompt configurations.

The `item.run()` context manager is used to create a new trace for each dataset item processed in the experiment. Optionally you can score the dataset runs.


```python
from langfuse import get_client
 
langfuse = get_client()
dataset_name = "capital_cities_11"
current_run_name = "capital_cities_run-llama-index_01" # Identifies this specific evaluation run
current_run_metadata={"model_provider": "OpenAI", "temperature_setting": 0.7},
current_run_description="Evaluation run for Q&A model on June 4th"
 
# Assume 'your_application' is your instrumented application function
def your_application(question):
    with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="llama-index-trace") as span:

        response = llm.complete(question)
        print(response)
 
        # Update the trace with the input and output
        span.update_trace(
            input=question,
            output=response.text,
        )
 
        return response.text
 
dataset = langfuse.get_dataset(name=dataset_name) # Fetch your pre-populated dataset
 
for item in dataset.items:
    print(f"Running evaluation for item: {item.id} (Input: {item.input['country']})")
 
    # Use the item.run() context manager
    with item.run(
        run_name=current_run_name,
        run_metadata=current_run_metadata,
        run_description=current_run_description
    ) as root_span: 
        # All subsequent langfuse operations within this block are part of this trace.
        generated_answer = your_application(
            question="What is the capital of " + item.input["country"] + "? Just answer with the name of the city.",
        )
 
        # Optionally, score the result against the expected output
        if item.expected_output and generated_answer == item.expected_output:
            root_span.score_trace(name="exact_match", value=1.0)
        else:
            root_span.score_trace(name="exact_match", value=0.0)
 
print(f"\nFinished processing dataset '{dataset_name}' for run '{current_run_name}'.")

```

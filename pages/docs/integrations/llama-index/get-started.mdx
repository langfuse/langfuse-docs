# ðŸ¦™ LlamaIndex Integration

**LlamaIndex** ([GitHub](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index)) is an advanced "data framework" tailored for augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with private data.

> It streamlines the integration of diverse data sources and formats (APIs, PDFs, docs, SQL, etc.) through versatile data connectors and structures data into indices and graphs for LLM compatibility. The platform offers a sophisticated retrieval/query interface for enriching LLM inputs with context-specific outputs. Designed for both beginners and experts, LlamaIndex provides a user-friendly high-level API for easy data ingestion and querying, alongside customizable lower-level APIs for detailed module adaptation.

Langfuse offers a simple integration for automatic capture of traces and metrics generated in LlamaIndex applications. **Any feedback?** Let us know on Discord or GitHub. This is a new integration, and we'd love to hear your thoughts.

## Add Langfuse to your LlamaIndex application

Make sure you have both `llama-index` and `langfuse` installed.

```bash
pip install llama-index --upgrade
pip install langfuse --upgrade
```

At the root of your LlamaIndex application, register Langfuse's `LlamaIndexCallbackHandler` in the LlamaIndex `Settings.callback_manager`. When instantiating `LlamaIndexCallbackHandler`, make sure to configure it correctly with your Langfuse API keys and the Host URL.

  Done! Traces and metrics from your LlamaIndex application are now
  automatically tracked in Langfuse. If you construct a new index or query an
  LLM with your documents in context, your traces and metrics are immediately
  visible in the Langfuse UI.

## Additional configuration

### Queuing and flushing

The Langfuse SDKs queue and batches events in the background to reduce the number of network requests and improve overall performance. In a long-running application, this works without any additional configuration.

If you are running a short-lived application, you need to flush Langfuse to ensure that all events are flushed before the application exits.

```python
langfuse_handler.flush()
```

### Setting a root trace or span
If you have an existing Langfuse trace or span object, you can set it as the root observation for your `LlamaIndexCallbackHandler`. Subsequent traces and spans will be nested under this root. This is useful when your LlamaIndex executions are part of a larger application and you want to link all traces and spans together. This can also be useful when you'd like to group multiple LlamaIndex executions to be part of the same trace or span.

Note that the input and output of your provided root trace or span must be set manually and is not managed by the LlamaIndexCallbackHandler to avoid overwrite issues.

```python
from llama_index.core import Settings
from llama_index.core.callbacks import CallbackManager
from langfuse import langfuse

# Create a new trace on your main execution path
root_trace = langfuse.trace(...)

# Instantiate a new LlamaIndexCallbackHandler and register it in the LlamaIndex Settings
langfuse_callback_handler = LlamaIndexCallbackHandler()
Settings.callback_manager = CallbackManager([langfuse_callback_handler])

# Set the root trace, subsequent LlamaIndex observations will be nested under root
langfuse_callback_handler.set_root(root_trace)

# Reset root, subsequent LlamaIndex observations will now use the default grouping and trace creation
langfuse_callback_handler.set_root(None)


```

### Updating trace parameters

You can update trace parameters at any time to add additional context to a trace, such as a user ID, session ID, or tags. See the [Python SDK Trace documentation](/docs/sdk/python#traces) for more information. All subsequent traces will include these set parameters. 

Note that when setting a root trace or span, this setting will have no effect as the root trace or span will be used.

```python
langfuse_handler.set_trace_params(
    user_id="user-123",
    session_id="session-abc",
    tags=["production"]
)
```

# Langfuse Integration with LobeChat

## What is LobeChat?

[LobeChat](https://lobehub.com/) is an **[open-source](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat) LLM chat platform** that seamlessly integrates with various AI models and tools, providing users with an intuitive interface to interact with advanced language technologies.

## What is Langfuse?

[Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) is one of the most used **open-source LLM Observability platforms**. By enabling the Langfuse integration, you can trace your application data with Langfuse to develop, monitor, and improve the use of LobeChat, including:

- Application [traces](/docs/tracing)
- Usage patterns
- Cost data by user and model
- [Evaluations](/docs/scores/overview)

## Get Started

<Steps>

### Set up Langfuse

Get your Langfuse API key by signing up for [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com) or [self-hosting](/self-hosting) Langfuse.

### Set up LobeChat

There are multiple ways to [self-host LobeChat](https://lobehub.com/docs/self-hosting/start). For this example, we will use the Docker Desktop deployment.

<Tabs items={["Environment Variables", "Example in Docker Desktop"]}>
<Tab>

Before deploying LobeChat, set the following four environment variables with the Langfuse API keys you created in the previous step.

```sh
ENABLE_LANGFUSE = '1'
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY = 'sk-lf...'
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'pk-lf...'
LANGFUSE_HOST = 'https://cloud.langfuse.com'
```

</Tab>

<Tab>

Before running the Docker container, set the environment variables in the Docker Desktop with the Langfuse API keys you created in the previous step.

### Activate Analytics in Settings

Once you have LobeChat running, navigate to the **About** tab in the **Settings** and activate analytics. This is necessary for traces to be sent to Langfuse.

### See your traces in Langfuse

After setting your LLM model key, you can start interacting with your LobeChat application.

<Frame border className="mt-5">

All conversations in the chat are automatically traced and sent to Langfuse. You can view the traces in the [Traces section](/docs/tracing) of the Langfuse platform.

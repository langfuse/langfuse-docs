#  Observability for Mastra with Langfuse

This guide shows you how to integrate **Langfuse** with **Mastra** for observability and tracing. By following these steps, you'll be able to monitor and debug your Mastra agents in the Langfuse dashboard.

> **What is Mastra?** [Mastra](https://mastra.ai) is the TypeScript agent framework designed to provide the essential primitives for building AI applications. It enables developers to create AI agents with memory and tool-calling capabilities, implement deterministic LLM workflows, and leverage RAG for knowledge integration.

## Integration

<Steps>

  ### Create a Mastra project
  If you don't have a Mastra project yet, you can create one using the Mastra CLI:

  ```bash
  npx create-mastra
  ```

  Move into the project directory:

  ```bash
  cd your-mastra-project
  ```

  You can get the full Mastra installation instructions [here](https://mastra.ai/docs/getting-started/installation)

  ### Set up Langfuse project
  Create a project in [Langfuse](https://cloud.langfuse.com) and get your API keys from the project settings page.


  ### Add environment variables
  Create or update your `.env.development` file with the following variables:

  ```bash
  # Your LLM API key
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key

  # Langfuse credentials
  LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...
  LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-...
  LANGFUSE_HOST=https://cloud.langfuse.com # Optional. Defaults to https://cloud.langfuse.com
  ```

  ### Install the `langfuse-vercel` package
  Add the `langfuse-vercel` package to your project:

  ```bash
  npm install langfuse-vercel
  ```

  ### Set up an agent
  Create an agent in your project. For example, create a file `agents/chefAgent.ts`:

  ```typescript
  import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
  import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

  export const chefAgent = new Agent({
    name: "chef-agent",
    instructions:
      "You are Michel, a practical and experienced home chef " +
      "You help people cook with whatever ingredients they have available.",
    model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  });
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
  You can use any model provider from `ai-sdk`.
  </Callout>


  ### Register agent and configure Langfuse
  Create or update your Mastra instance configuration to register the agent and configure Langfuse integration. For example, create a file `mastra.ts`:

  ```typescript
  import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
  import { LangfuseExporter } from "langfuse-vercel";
  import { chefAgent } from "./agents/chefAgent";

  export const mastra = new Mastra({
    agents: { chefAgent },
    telemetry: {
      serviceName: "ai", // this must be set to "ai" so that the LangfuseExporter thinks it's an AI SDK trace
      enabled: true,
      export: {
        type: "custom",
        exporter: new LangfuseExporter({
            publicKey: process.env.LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY,
            secretKey: process.env.LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY,
            baseUrl: process.env.LANGFUSE_HOST,
        }),
      },
    },
  });
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
    The `telemetry.serviceName` field must be set to "ai" so that the LangfuseExporter thinks it's an AI SDK trace.
  </Callout>

  ### Run mastra dev server
  Start the Mastra development server:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  Head over to the developer playground with the provided URL and start chatting with your agent.


  ### View traces in Langfuse
  Head over to your [Langfuse dashboard](https://cloud.langfuse.com) and you'll see the traces from your agent interactions. You can analyze the prompts, completions, and other details of your AI interactions.

  Here's an example of a trace:

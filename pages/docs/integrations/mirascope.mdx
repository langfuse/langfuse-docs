# Mirascope Integration

**Mirascope** ([GitHub](https://github.com/mirascope/mirascope)) is a Python toolkit for building LLM applications.

> Developing LLM-applications with Mirascope feels just like writing the Python code youâ€™re already used to.
> Python Toolkit for LLMs: Mirascope simplifies the development of applications using Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing an intuitive interface similar to standard Python coding practices.

The Mirascope team recorded a video with a short demo of how to use Mirascope with Langfuse.

## How to use Mirascope with Langfuse

```python
from mirascope.langfuse import with_langfuse
```

Mirascope automatically passes the Langfuse [`observe()` decorator](/docs/sdk/python/decorators) to all relevant functions within Mirascope via its `with_langfuse` decorator.

## Example

### Call

This is a basic call example but will work with all of Mirascope's call functions, `call`, `stream`, `call_async`, `stream_async`.

```python /@with_langfuse/ /from mirascope.langfuse import with_langfuse/
import os
from mirascope.langfuse import with_langfuse
from mirascope.anthropic import AnthropicCall

os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com"


@with_langfuse
class BookRecommender(AnthropicCall):
    prompt_template = "Please recommend some {genre} books"

    genre: str


recommender = BookRecommender(genre="fantasy")
response = recommender.call()  # this will automatically get logged with langfuse
print(response.content)
#> Here are some recommendations for great fantasy book series: ...
```

This will give you:

- A trace around the AnthropicCall.call() that captures items like the prompt template, and input/output attributes and more.
- Human-readable display of the conversation with the agent
- Details of the response, including the number of tokens used

### Extract

> Mirascope's extraction functionality is built on top of Pydantic and offers a convenient `extract` method on extractor classes to extract structured information from LLM outputs. This method leverages tools (function calling) to reliably extract the required structured data. ([Docs](https://docs.mirascope.io/latest/concepts/extracting_structured_information_using_llms/))

```python /@with_langfuse/ /from mirascope.langfuse import with_langfuse/
import os
from mirascope.langfuse import with_langfuse
from mirascope.openai import OpenAIExtractor

os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com"

class TaskDetails(BaseModel):
    description: str
    due_date: str
    priority: Literal["low", "normal", "high"]


@with_langfuse
class TaskExtractor(OpenAIExtractor[TaskDetails]):
    extract_schema: Type[TaskDetails] = TaskDetails
    prompt_template = """
    Extract the task details from the following task:
    {task}
    """

    task: str


task = "Submit quarterly report by next Friday. Task is high priority."
task_details = TaskExtractor(
    task=task
).extract()  # this will be logged automatically with langfuse
assert isinstance(task_details, TaskDetails)
print(task_details)
# > description='Submit quarterly report' due_date='next Friday' priority='high'
```

This will give you the same view as you would get from using the [OpenAI integration](/docs/integrations/openai). We will be adding more extraction support for other providers soon.

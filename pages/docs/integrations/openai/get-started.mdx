# Observability for OpenAI SDK (Python)

If you use the OpenAI Python SDK, you can use the Langfuse **drop-in replacement** to get full logging by changing only the import.

```diff
- import openai
+ from langfuse.openai import openai
```

Langfuse automatically tracks:

- All prompts/completions with support for streaming, async and functions
- Latencies
- API Errors ([example](/docs/integrations/openai/track-errors))
- Model usage (tokens) and cost (USD) ([learn more](/docs/model-usage-and-cost))

_In the Langfuse Console_

import { CloudflareVideo } from "@/components/Video";

<CloudflareVideo
  videoId="53740b20a378b166552ff1941ed38e4c"
  aspectRatio={16 / 9.8}
  gifStyle
/>

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

  Currently only Python is supported by this integration. If you are interested
  in an integration with the **Node.js/Typescript OpenAI SDK**, add your
  upvote/comments to [this
  issue](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/844).
</Callout>

## How it works

<Steps>

### Install Langfuse SDK

The integration is compatible with OpenAI SDK versions `>=0.27.8`. It supports async functions and streaming for OpenAI SDK versions `>=1.0.0`.

```sh
pip install langfuse openai
```

### Switch to Langfuse Wrapped OpenAI SDK

<Tabs items={["Environment variables", "Attributes"]}>

<Tab>

Add Langfuse credentials to your environment variables

import EnvPython from "@/components-mdx/env-python.mdx";

<EnvPython />

Change import

```diff
- import openai
+ from langfuse.openai import openai
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

Change import

```diff
- import openai
+ from langfuse.openai import openai
```

Add Langfuse credentials to your code

```python
openai.langfuse_public_key"pk-lf-..."
openai.langfuse_secret_key="sk-lf-..."
openai.langfuse_host="https://cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇪🇺 EU region
# openai.langfuse_host="https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇺🇸 US region
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Optional, checks the SDK connection with the server. Not recommended for production usage.

```python
openai.auth_check()
```

### Use OpenAI SDK as usual

_No changes required._

Check out the notebook for end-to-end examples of the integration:

import { FileCode } from "lucide-react";

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Example notebook"
    href="/docs/integrations/openai/examples"
    icon={<FileCode />}
  />
  <Card
    title="Error tracking example"
    href="/docs/integrations/openai/track-errors"
    icon={<FileCode />}
  />
</Cards>

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Queuing and batching of events

The Langfuse SDKs queue and batches events in the background to reduce the number of network requests and improve overall performance. In a long-running application, this works without any additional configuration.

If you are running a short-lived application, you need to flush Langfuse to ensure that all events are flushed before the application exits.

```python
openai.flush_langfuse()
```

Learn more about queuing and batching of events [here](/docs/tracing/overview).

### Debug mode

If you are having issues with the integration, you can enable debug mode to get more information about the requests and responses.

```python
openai.langfuse_debug=True
```

## Advanced usage

### Custom trace properties

You can add the following properties to the openai method, e.g. `openai.chat.completions.create()`, to use additional Langfuse features:

| Property                | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                  | Set `name` to identify a specific type of generation.                        |
| `metadata`              | Set `metadata` with additional information that you want to see in Langfuse. |
| `session_id`            | The current [session](/docs/tracing/sessions).                               |
| `user_id`               | The current [user_id](/docs/tracing/users).                                  |
| `tags`                  | Set [tags](/docs/tracing/tags) to categorize and filter traces.              |
| `trace_id`              | See "Interoperability with Langfuse Python SDK" (below) for more details.    |
| `parent_observation_id` | See "Interoperability with Langfuse Python SDK" (below) for more details.    |

Example:

```python {6-7}
openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a very accurate calculator. You output only the result of the calculation."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "1 + 1 = "}],
    name="test-chat",
    metadata={"someMetadataKey": "someValue"},
)
```

### Group multiple LLM calls into a single trace

Usually, this integration creates a single trace in Langfuse for each openai call. If you want to group multiple openai calls into a single trace, you can use the `trace_id` property. This can be either a random id or an existing id from your application that will be unique to this execution.

```python {3,14,23}
from langfuse.openai import openai
from uuid import uuid4
trace_id = str(uuid4())

country = "Bulgaria"

capital = openai.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[
      {"role": "system", "content": "What is the capital of the country?"},
      {"role": "user", "content": country}],
  temperature=0,
  name="get-capital",
  trace_id=trace_id
).choices[0].message.content

poem = openai.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a poet. Create a poem about this city."},
      {"role": "user", "content": capital}],
  name="generate-poem",
  trace_id=trace_id
).choices[0].message.content
```

Now both generations are grouped in the same trace with the `trace_id` assigned by you.

```
TRACE (id: trace_id)
|
|-- GENERATION: get-capital
|
|-- GENERATION: generate-poem
```

If you want to add further properties or observations to the trace, read the next section.

### Interoperability with Langfuse Python SDK

Use the OpenAI integration in combination with the regular Langfuse SDKs ([full reference](/docs/sdk/python)) if you want to:

- Add non-OpenAI related observations to the trace.
- Group multiple OpenAI calls into a single trace while customizing the trace.
- Have more control over the trace structure.

  messages=[
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a poet. Create a poem about this city."},
      {"role": "user", "content": capital}],
  name="generate-poem",
  trace_id=trace_id
).choices[0].message.content
```

</Tab>
<Tab>
Desired trace structure:

```
TRACE: capital-poem-generator
|
|-- SPAN: Bulgaria
|   |
|   |-- GENERATION: get-capital
|   |
|   |-- GENERATION: generate-poem
|
|-- SPAN: France
|   |
|   |-- GENERATION: get-capital
|   |
|   |-- GENERATION: generate-poem
```

Implementation

```python showLineNumbers {5,8,12,20-21,30-31,35}
from langfuse import Langfuse
from langfuse.openai import openai

# initialize SDK
langfuse = Langfuse()

# create trace and add params
trace = langfuse.trace(name="capital-poem-generator")

for country in ["Bulgaria", "France"]:
  # create span
  span = trace.span(name=country)

  capital = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "What is the capital of the country?"},
        {"role": "user", "content": country}],
    name="get-capital",
    trace_id=trace.id,
    parent_observation_id=span.id,
  ).choices[0].message.content

  poem = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a poet. Create a poem about this city."},
        {"role": "user", "content": capital}],
    name="generate-poem",
    trace_id=trace.id,
    parent_observation_id=span.id,
  ).choices[0].message.content

  # End span to get span-level latencies
  span.end()
```

_Note that you need to provide `trace_id` and `parent_observation_id` to each generation._

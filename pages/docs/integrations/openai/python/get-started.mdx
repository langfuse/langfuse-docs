# Observability for OpenAI SDK (Python)

<Callout type="info">
  Looking for the JS/TS version? [Check it out
  here](/docs/integrations/openai/js/get-started).
</Callout>

If you use the OpenAI Python SDK, you can use the Langfuse **drop-in replacement** to get full logging by changing only the import. This works with OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.

```diff
- import openai
+ from langfuse.openai import openai

Alternative imports:
+ from langfuse.openai import OpenAI, AsyncOpenAI, AzureOpenAI, AsyncAzureOpenAI
```

Langfuse automatically tracks:

- All prompts/completions with support for streaming, async and functions
- Latencies
- API Errors ([example](/docs/integrations/openai/track-errors))
- Model usage (tokens) and cost (USD) ([learn more](/docs/model-usage-and-cost))

_In the Langfuse Console_

## How it works

<Steps>

### Install Langfuse SDK

The integration is compatible with OpenAI SDK versions `>=0.27.8`. It supports async functions and streaming for OpenAI SDK versions `>=1.0.0`.

```sh
pip install langfuse openai
```

### Switch to Langfuse Wrapped OpenAI SDK

<Tabs items={["Environment variables", "Attributes"]}>

<Tab>

Add Langfuse credentials to your environment variables

import EnvPython from "@/components-mdx/env-python.mdx";

<EnvPython />

Change import

```diff
- import openai
+ from langfuse.openai import openai

Alternative imports:
+ from langfuse.openai import OpenAI, AsyncOpenAI, AzureOpenAI, AsyncAzureOpenAI
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

Change import

```diff
- import openai
+ from langfuse.openai import openai

Alternative imports:
+ from langfuse.openai import OpenAI, AsyncOpenAI, AzureOpenAI, AsyncAzureOpenAI
```

Add Langfuse credentials to your code

```python
openai.langfuse_public_key"pk-lf-..."
openai.langfuse_secret_key="sk-lf-..."
openai.langfuse_enabled=True # Default is True, set to False to disable Langfuse
openai.langfuse_host="https://cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇪🇺 EU region
# openai.langfuse_host="https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇺🇸 US region
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Optional, checks the SDK connection with the server. Not recommended for production usage.

```python
openai.langfuse_auth_check()
```

### Use OpenAI SDK as usual

_No changes required._

Check out the notebook for end-to-end examples of the integration:

import { FileCode } from "lucide-react";

    href="/docs/integrations/openai/python/track-errors"
    icon={<FileCode />}
  />
</Cards>

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Queuing and batching of events

The Langfuse SDKs queue and batches events in the background to reduce the number of network requests and improve overall performance. In a long-running application, this works without any additional configuration.

If you are running a short-lived application, you need to flush Langfuse to ensure that all events are flushed before the application exits.

```python
from langfuse.openai import openai

...

openai.flush_langfuse()
```

Learn more about queuing and batching of events [here](/docs/tracing).

### Assistants API

Tracing of the assistants api is not supported by this integration as OpenAI Assistants have server-side state that cannot easily be captured without additional api requests. We added some more information on how to best track usage of the assistants api in this [FAQ](/faq/all/openai-assistant-api).

### Debug mode

If you are having issues with the integration, you can enable debug mode to get more information about the requests and responses.

```python
from langfuse.openai import openai

openai.langfuse_debug = True
```
### Sampling

[Sampling](/docs/tracing-features/sampling) can be used to control the volume of traces collected by the Langfuse server.

```python
from langfuse.openai import openai

openai.langfuse_sample_rate = 0.1 # send only 10% of traces to Langfuse servers
```

### Streaming function / tool calls

The capture of input and output when streaming function / tool calls is currently not supported. Please upvote this feature request in the [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/2055) if you would like to see this supported going forward.

## Advanced usage

### Custom trace properties

You can add the following properties to the openai method, e.g. `openai.chat.completions.create()`, to use additional Langfuse features:

| Property                | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                  | Set `name` to identify a specific type of generation.                        |
| `metadata`              | Set `metadata` with additional information that you want to see in Langfuse. |
| `session_id`            | The current [session](/docs/tracing-features/sessions).                      |
| `user_id`               | The current [user_id](/docs/tracing-features/users).                         |
| `tags`                  | Set [tags](/docs/tracing-features/tags) to categorize and filter traces.     |
| `trace_id`              | See "Interoperability with Langfuse Python SDK" (below) for more details.    |
| `parent_observation_id` | See "Interoperability with Langfuse Python SDK" (below) for more details.    |

Example:

```python {6-7}
openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a very accurate calculator. You output only the result of the calculation."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "1 + 1 = "}],
    name="test-chat",
    metadata={"someMetadataKey": "someValue"},
)
```

### Use Traces

[Langfuse Tracing](/docs/tracing) groups multiple observations (can be any LLM or non-LLM call) into a single trace. This integration by default creates a single trace for each openai call.

- Add non-OpenAI related observations to the trace.
- Group multiple OpenAI calls into a single trace while customizing the trace.
- Have more control over the trace structure.
- Use all Langfuse Tracing features.

  basic concepts.
</Callout>

You can use any of the following three options:

1. [Python `@observe()` decorator](/docs/sdk/python/decorators)
2. Set `trace_id` property, best if you have an existing id from your application.
3. Use the [low-level SDK](/docs/sdk/python/low-level-sdk) to create traces manually and add OpenAI calls to it.

    for country in countries:
        capital_poem_generator(country)

Usually, this integration creates a single trace in Langfuse for each openai call. If you want to group multiple openai calls into a single trace, you can use the `trace_id` property. This can be either a random id or an existing id from your application that will be unique to this execution.

```python {3,14,23}
from langfuse.openai import openai
from uuid import uuid4
trace_id = str(uuid4())

country = "Bulgaria"

capital = openai.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[
      {"role": "system", "content": "What is the capital of the country?"},
      {"role": "user", "content": country}],
  temperature=0,
  name="get-capital",
  trace_id=trace_id
).choices[0].message.content

poem = openai.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a poet. Create a poem about this city."},
      {"role": "user", "content": capital}],
  name="generate-poem",
  trace_id=trace_id
).choices[0].message.content
```

Now both generations are grouped in the same trace with the `trace_id` assigned by you.

```
TRACE (id: trace_id)
|
|-- GENERATION: get-capital
|
|-- GENERATION: generate-poem
```

If you want more control over the trace structure, use the Decorator or Low-level SDK.

### OpenAI token usage on streamed responses

OpenAI returns the token usage on streamed responses only when in `stream_options` the `include_usage` parameter is set to `True`. If you would like to benefit from OpenAI's directly provided token usage, you can set `{"include_usage": True} in the `stream_options` argument.

<Callout type="info">
  When using streaming responses with `include_usage=True`, OpenAI returns token usage information in a final chunk that has an empty `choices` list. Make sure your application properly handles these empty `choices` chunks to ensure accurate token usage tracking by not trying to access some index in the `choices` list without checking if it is non-empty.
</Callout>

```python /stream_options={"include_usage": True}/
from langfuse.openai import openai

client = openai.OpenAI()

stream = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4o",
  messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "How are you?"}],
  stream=True,
  stream_options={"include_usage": True},
)

result = ""

for chunk in stream:
  # Check if chunk choices are not empty. OpenAI returns token usage in a final chunk with an empty choices list.
  if chunk.choices:
    result += chunk.choices[0].delta.content or ""

openai.flush_langfuse()
```

### OpenAI Beta APIs

Since OpenAI beta APIs are changing frequently across versions, we fully support only the stable APIs in the OpenAI SDK. If you are using a beta API, you can still use the Langfuse SDK by wrapping the OpenAI SDK manually with the `@observe()` [decorator](/docs/sdk/python/decorators).

#### Structured Output

For **structured output parsing**, please use the `response_format` argument to `openai.chat.completions.create()` instead of the Beta API. This will allow you to set Langfuse attributes and metadata.

If you rely on parsing Pydantic defintions for your `response_format`, you may leverage the `type_to_response_format_param` utility function from the OpenAI Python SDK to convert the Pydantic definition to a `response_format` dictionary. This is the same function the OpenAI Beta API uses to convert Pydantic definitions to `response_format` dictionaries.

```python
from langfuse.openai import openai
from openai.lib._parsing._completions import type_to_response_format_param
from pydantic import BaseModel

class CalendarEvent(BaseModel):
  name: str
  date: str
  participants: list[str]


completion = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Extract the event information."},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Alice and Bob are going to a science fair on Friday.",
        },
    ],
    response_format=type_to_response_format_param(CalendarEvent),
)

print(completion)

openai.flush_langfuse()
```

#### Assistants API

Tracing of the assistants api is not supported by this integration as OpenAI Assistants have server-side state that cannot easily be captured without additional api requests. Check out this [notebook](/docs/integrations/openai/python/assistants-api) for an end-to-end example on how to best track usage of the assistants api in Langfuse.

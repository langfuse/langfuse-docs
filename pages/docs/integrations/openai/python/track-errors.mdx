# Tracking of OpenAI API Errors

Langfuse Langfuse automatically tracks and monitors OpenAI API errors if you use the native integration. They are captured via the `level` and `statusMessage` fields (see [docs](/docs/tracing-features/log-levels)).

Learn more about how to get started [here](/docs/integrations/openai/get-started).

```diff
- import openai
+ from langfuse.openai import openai
```

```python
# Cause an error by attempting to use a host that does not exist.
openai.base_url = "https://example.com"

country = openai.chat.completions.create(
  name="will-error",
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[
      {"role": "user", "content": "How are you?"}],
)
```

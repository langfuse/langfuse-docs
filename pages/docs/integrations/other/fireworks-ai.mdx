# Observability for Fireworks AI with Langfuse

This guide shows you how to integrate Fireworks AI with Langfuse. Fireworks AI's API endpoints are fully [compatible](https://docs.fireworks.ai/tools-sdks/openai-compatibility) with the OpenAI SDK, allowing you to trace and monitor your AI applications seamlessly.

> **What is Fireworks AI?** [Fireworks AI](https://fireworks.ai/) is a platform that provides API access to state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary AI models with OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

> **What is Langfuse?** [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is an open source LLM engineering platform that helps teams trace API calls, monitor performance, and debug issues in their AI applications.

<Steps>
## Step 1: Install Dependencies


```python
%pip install openai langfuse
```

## Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables


```python
import os

# Get keys for your project from the project settings page
# https://cloud.langfuse.com

os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇪🇺 EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇺🇸 US region

# Set your Fireworks API details
os.environ["FIREWORKS_AI_API_BASE"] = "https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1"
os.environ["FIREWORKS_AI_API_KEY"] = "fw_..."
```

## Step 3: Use Langfuse OpenAI Drop-in Replacement


```python
from langfuse.openai import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
  api_key=os.environ.get("FIREWORKS_AI_API_KEY"),
  base_url=os.environ.get("FIREWORKS_AI_API_BASE")
)
```

## Step 4: Run an Example


```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3p1-8b-instruct",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Why is open source important?"},
  ],
  name = "Fireworks-AI-Trace" # name of the trace
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Step 5: See Traces in Langfuse

After running the example, log in to Langfuse to view the detailed traces, including:

- Request parameters
- Response content
- Token usage and latency metrics

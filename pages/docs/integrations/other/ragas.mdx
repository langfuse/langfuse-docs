# RAG pipeline evaluation with Ragas and Langfuse

Ragas and Langfuse is a powerful combination that can help you evaluate and monitor your Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.

## What is Langfuse?

Langfuse ([GitHub](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse)) is a platform for LLM [tracing](/docs/tracing), [prompt management](/docs/prompts/get-started), and [evaluation](/docs/scores/overview). It allows you to score your traces and spans, providing insights into the performance of your RAG pipelines. Langfuse supports various integrations, including [OpenAI](/docs/integrations/openai/python/get-started), [Langchain](/docs/integrations/langchain/tracing), and [more](/docs/integrations/overview).

## What is Ragas?

[Ragas](https://docs.ragas.io/) is an open-source tool designed for model-based evaluation of RAG pipelines. It performs reference-free evaluations, meaning you don't need ground-truth data to assess your system's performance. Ragas can evaluate various aspects of your RAG pipeline, such as faithfulness, answer relevancy, and context precision.

**Common use cases for Ragas include:**

- **Evaluate RAG Pipelines:** Generate synthetic test sets and assess pipeline performance using metrics like faithfulness and answer relevance.
- **Custom Prompt Adaptation:** Write and optimize custom prompts with automatic adaptation for improved retrieval and generation.
- **CI Pipeline Integration:** Integrate Ragas with CI pipelines using Pytest for automated evaluation and monitoring.

## Key Benefits of using Langfuse with Ragas

- **Score Traces**: [Score](/docs/scores/overview) your traces and spans, providing insights into the performance of your RAG pipelines.
- **Detailed Analytics**: Segment and [analyze](/docs/analytics/overview) traces to identify low-quality scores and improve your system's performance.
- **Score Reporting**: Drill down into detailed reports for specific use cases and user segments.

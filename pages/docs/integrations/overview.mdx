# Integration Overview

Integrate your application with Langfuse to explore production traces and metrics.

Objective:

1. Capture [traces](/docs/tracing/overview) of your application
2. Add [scores](/docs/scores) to these traces to measure/evaluate quality of outputs

There are currently four main ways to integrate with Langfuse:

| Integration                               | Supports      | Description                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [SDK](/docs/sdk)                          | Python, JS/TS | Manual instrumentation using the SDKs for full flexibility.                     |
| [OpenAI](/docs/integrations/openai)       | Python        | Automated instrumentation using drop-in replacement of OpenAI SDK.              |
| [Langchain](/docs/integrations/langchain) | Python, JS/TS | Automated instrumentation by passing callback handler to Langchain application. |
| [API](/docs/api)                          |               | Directly call the public API. OpenAPI spec available.                           |

In addition, Langfuse is natively integrated with the following projects/packages:

| Name                                        | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Flowise](/docs/integrations/flowise)       | JS/TS no-code builder for customized LLM flows.                                                                                                  |
| [Langflow](/docs/integrations/langflow)     | Python-based UI for LangChain, designed with react-flow to provide an effortless way to experiment and prototype flows.                          |
| [LiteLLM](/docs/integrations/litellm)       | Use any LLM as a drop in replacement for GPT. Use Azure, OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic, Ollama, VLLM, Sagemaker, HuggingFace, Replicate (100+ LLMs). |
| [Superagent](/docs/integrations/superagent) | Open Source AI Assistant Framework & API for prototyping and deployment of agents.                                                               |

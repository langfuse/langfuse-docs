# Integration Overview

Integrate your application with Langfuse to explore production traces and metrics.

Objective:

1. Capture [traces](/docs/tracing) of your application
2. Add [scores](/docs/scores) to these traces to measure/evaluate quality of outputs

There are currently six main ways to integrate with Langfuse:

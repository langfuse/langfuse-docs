# Integrating Langfuse with Quarkus LangChain4j

This guide shows how to integrate [Langfuse](/) with [Quarkus LangChain4j](https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-langchain4j/dev/index.html) using OpenTelemetry.

**Quarkus LangChain4j**: A [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) based integration of [LangChain4j](https://docs.langchain4j.dev/) for AI development with built-in OTel tracing for AI calls.

**Langfuse**: Open source LLM engineering platform for observability, evals and prompt management.

## Step 1: Enable OpenTelemetry in Quarkus LangChain4j

**Add Quarkus OpenTelemetry Dependency** (Maven):

For Maven, add the following to your `pom.xml` (Gradle users can include equivalent coordinates in Gradle):

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-opentelemetry</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

**Configure OpenTelemetry exporter** (`application.properties`):

```properties
quarkus.otel.exporter.otlp.traces.protocol=http/protobuf
```

With these configurations and dependencies in place, your Quarkus application is ready to produce OpenTelemetry traces. Quarkus LangChain4j internal calls (e.g. when you invoke a chat model) will be recorded as spans.

Each span will carry attributes like `gen_ai.operation.name`, `gen_ai.system` (the provider, e.g. ‚Äúopenai‚Äù), model names, token usage, etc.
In order to enable events for the prompt and response content you need to activate the langchain4j prompt tracing.

**Configure Langchain4j prompt tracing** (`application.properties`):

```properties
quarkus.langchain4j.tracing.include-prompt=true
quarkus.langchain4j.tracing.include-completion=true
```

## Step 2: Configure Langfuse

Now that your Quarkus application is emitting OpenTelemetry trace data, the next step is to direct that data to Langfuse.

Langfuse will act as the ‚Äúbackend‚Äù for OpenTelemetry in this setup ‚Äì essentially replacing a typical Jaeger/Zipkin/OTel-Collector with Langfuse‚Äôs trace ingestion API.


**Langfuse Setup**
   - Sign up for [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com/) or [self-hosted Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting).
   - Set the OTLP endpoint (e.g. `https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/otel`) and API keys.

Configure these via environment variables:

```bash
QUARKUS_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: set this to the Langfuse OTLP URL (e.g. https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/otel).
QUARKUS_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS: set this to Authorization=Basic <base64 public:secret>.
```

## Step 3: Run a Test AI Operation

Start your Quarkus application. Trigger an AI operation that Quarkus LangChain4j handles ‚Äì for example, call a service or controller that uses a `ChatModel` to generate a completion.

**Note**: A complete example can be found [here](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-examples/tree/main/applications/quarkus-langchain4j-demo)

```java
@RegisterAiService(tools = EmailService.class)
public interface MyAiService {

    /**
     * Ask the LLM to create a poem about the given topic.
     *
     * @param topic the topic of the poem
     * @param lines the number of line of the poem
     * @return the poem
     */
    @SystemMessage("You are a professional poet")
    @UserMessage("""
            Write a single poem about {topic}. The poem should be {lines} lines long and your response should only include the poem itself, nothing else.
            Then send this poem by email. Your response should include the poem.
            """)
    String writeAPoem(String topic, int lines);

}

@Singleton
public class Startup {

    public void writeAPoem(@Observes StartupEvent event, MyAiService service) {
        System.out.println(service.writeAPoem("LangFuse", 4));
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**No Traces:**
  - Check the logs of the application for potential clues
  - Check [Troubleshooting](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting/troubleshooting#missing-events-after-post-apipublicingestion) page

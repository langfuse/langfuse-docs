# Local Machine

## Requirements

- `docker` and `docker compose`, both included in [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Docker compose

This setup is the easiest to get started with. It will start a local database and the langfuse server. The server is exposed on port `3030` by default. It is not recommended to use this setup in production as the database is not persisted.

```bash
# clone langfuse from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git

# switch into langfuse directory
cd langfuse

# create an env file
cp .env.local.example .env

# start langfuse
docker-compose up
```

Afterwards, use the langfuse [API](/docs/reference) or client [SDKs](/docs/sdk) to interact with the server, and view the [application ui](/docs/interface) at http://localhost:3030

## Local development

This setup is for local development. It will start a local database via Docker and the langfuse server via NPM. The server will be restarted on file changes.

```bash
# clone langfuse from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git

# switch into langfuse directory
cd langfuse

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the db
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Migration
npx prisma migrate dev

# Seed the database
npx prisma db seed

# Start the server
npm run dev
```

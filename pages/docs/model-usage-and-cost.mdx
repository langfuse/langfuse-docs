# Model Usage & Cost

Across Langfuse, usage and cost are tracked for LLM generations:

- **Usage**: token/character counts
- **Cost**: USD cost of the generation

Both usage and cost can be either

- [**ingested**](#ingest) via API, SDKs or integrations
- or [**inferred**](#infer) based on the `model` parameter of the generation. Langfuse comes with a list of predefined popular models and their tokenizers including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google models. You can also add your own [custom model definitions](#custom-model-definitions) or request official support for new models via [GitHub](/issue). Inferred cost are calculated at the time of ingestion.

Ingested usage and cost are prioritized over inferred usage and cost:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Ingested Observation]
  B["Usage (tokens or other unit)"]
  C["Cost (in USD)"]
  A --> D{Includes usage?}
  D -->|Yes| B
  D -->|No| E(Use tokenizer) --> B
  A --> F{Includes cost?}
  F -->|Yes| C
  F -->|No| G(Use model price/unit) --> C
  B -->|use usage| G
```

Via the [Daily Metrics API](/docs/analytics/daily-metrics-api), you can retrieve aggregated daily usage and cost metrics from Langfuse for downstream use in analytics, billing, and rate-limiting. The API allows you to filter by application type, user, or tags.

## Ingest usage and/or cost [#ingest]

If available in the LLM response, ingesting usage and/or cost is the most accurate and robust way to track usage in Langfuse.

Many of the Langfuse integrations automatically capture usage and cost data from the LLM response. If this does not work as expected, please create an [issue](/issue) on GitHub.

```python
@observe(as_type="generation")
def anthropic_completion(**kwargs):
  # optional, extract some fields from kwargs
  kwargs_clone = kwargs.copy()
  input = kwargs_clone.pop('messages', None)
  model = kwargs_clone.pop('model', None)
  langfuse_context.update_current_observation(
      input=input,

          "output": response.usage.output_tokens,
          # "total": int,  # if not set, it is derived from input + output
          "unit": "TOKENS", # any of: "TOKENS", "CHARACTERS", "MILLISECONDS", "SECONDS", "IMAGES"

          # Optionally, also ingest usd cost. Alternatively, you can infer it via a model definition in Langfuse.
          # Here we assume the input and output cost are 1 USD each.
          "input_cost": 1,
          "output_cost": 1,
          # "total_cost": float, # if not set, it is derived from input_cost + output_cost
      }
  )

  # return result
  return response.content[0].text

@observe()
def main():
  return anthropic_completion(
      model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
      max_tokens=1024,
      messages=[
          {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
      ]
  )

main()
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```python
generation = langfuse.generation(
  # ...
  usage={
    # usage
    "input": int,
    "output": int,
    "total": int,  # if not set, it is derived from input + output
    "unit": "TOKENS",  # any of: "TOKENS", "CHARACTERS", "MILLISECONDS", "SECONDS", "IMAGES"

```typescript
const generation = langfuse.generation({
  // ...
  usage: {
    // usage
    input: int,
    output: int,
    total: int, // optional, it is derived from input + output
    unit: "TOKENS", // "TOKENS" | "CHARACTERS" | "MILLISECONDS" | "SECONDS" | "IMAGES"

    // usd cost
    inputCost: float,
    outputCost: float,
    totalCost: float, // optional, it is derived from input + output
  },
  // ...
});
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

You can also update the usage and cost via `generation.update()` and `generation.end()`.

### Compatibility with OpenAI

For increased compatibility with OpenAI, you can also use the following attributes to ingest usage:

<Tabs items={["Python", "JS"]}>
<Tab>

```python
generation = langfuse.generation(
  # ...
  usage={
    # usage
    "prompt_tokens": int,
    "completion_tokens": int,
    "total_tokens": int,  # optional, it is derived from prompt + completion
  },
  # ...
)
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```typescript
const generation = langfuse.generation({
  // ...
  usage: {
    // usage
    promptTokens: integer,
    completionTokens: integer,
    totalTokens: integer, // optional, derived from prompt + completion
  },
  // ...
});
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

You can also ingest OpenAI-style usage via `generation.update()` and `generation.end()`.

## Infer usage and/or cost [#infer]

If either usage or cost are not ingested, Langfuse will attempt to infer the missing values based on the `model` parameter of the generation at the time of ingestion. This is especially useful for some model providers or self-hosted models which do not include usage or cost in the response.

Langfuse comes with a **list of predefined popular models and their tokenizers** including **OpenAI, Anthropic, Google**. Check out the [full list](https://cloud.langfuse.com/project/clkpwwm0m000gmm094odg11gi/models) (you need to sign-in).

You can also add your own **custom model definitions** (see [below](#custom-model-definitions)) or request official support for new models via [GitHub](/issue).

### Usage

If a tokenizer is specified for the model, Langfuse automatically calculates token amounts for ingested generations.

The following tokenizers are currently supported:

| Model     | Tokenizer     | Used package                                                                       | Comment                                                                                                                               |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gpt-4o`  | `o200k_base`  | [`tiktoken`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tiktoken)                               |                                                                                                                                       |
| `gpt*`    | `cl100k_base` | [`tiktoken`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tiktoken)                               |                                                                                                                                       |
| `claude*` | `claude`      | [`@anthropic-ai/tokenizer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/tokenizer) | According to Anthropic, their tokenizer is not accurate for Claude 3 models. If possible, send us the tokens from their API response. |

### Cost

Model definitions include prices per unit (input, output, total).

Langfuse automatically calculates cost for ingested generations at the time of ingestion if (1) usage is ingested or inferred, (2) and a matching model definition includes prices.

### Custom model definitions [#custom-model-definitions]

You can flexibly add your own model definitions to Langfuse. This is especially useful for self-hosted or fine-tuned models which are not included in the list of Langfuse maintained models.

  <Frame border>![Add model in UI](/images/docs/create-model.gif)</Frame>
</Tab>

<Tab>

Model definitions can also be managed programmatically via the Models API ([reference](https://api.reference.langfuse.com)):

```bash
GET    /api/public/models
POST   /api/public/models
GET    /api/public/models/{id}
DELETE /api/public/models/{id}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Models are matched to generations based on:

| Generation Attribute | Model Attribute | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `model`              | `match_pattern` | Uses regular expressions, e.g. `(?i)^(gpt-4-0125-preview)$` matches `gpt-4-0125-preview`.                                                                                                                                  |
| `unit`               | `unit`          | Unit on the usage object of the generation (e.g. `TOKENS` or `CHARACTERS`) needs to match.                                                                                                                                 |
| `start_time`         | `start_time`    | Optional, can be used to update the price of a model without affecting past generations. If multiple models match, the model with the most recent `model.start_time` that is earlier than `generation.start_time` is used. |

User-defined models take priority over models maintained by Langfuse.

**Further details**

When using the `openai` tokenizer, you need to specify the following tokenization config. You can also copy the config from the list of predefined OpenAI models. See the OpenAI [documentation](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/How_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken.ipynb) for further details. `tokensPerName` and `tokensPerMessage` are required for chat models.

```json
{
  "tokenizerModel": "gpt-3.5-turbo", // tiktoken model name
  "tokensPerName": -1, // OpenAI Chatmessage tokenization config
  "tokensPerMessage": 4 // OpenAI Chatmessage tokenization config
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**Usage and cost are missing for historical generations**. Except for changes in prices, Langfuse does not retroactively infer usage and cost for existing generations when model definitions are changed. You can request a batch job (Langfuse Cloud) or run a [script](/docs/deployment/self-host#migrate-models) (self-hosting) to apply new model definitions to existing generations.

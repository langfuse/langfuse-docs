# Agent Graphs

Agent graphs in Langfuse provide a visual representation of complex AI agent workflows, helping you understand and debug multi-step reasoning processes and agent interactions.

_Example trace with agent graph view ([public link](https://cloud.langfuse.com/project/cloramnkj0002jz088vzn1ja4/traces/8ed12d68-353f-464f-bc62-720984c3b6a0))_

## Get Started

<Callout type="info">

The graph view is currently in beta, please feel free to share feedback.

</Callout>

There are currently two ways to display the graph.
First, have an observation with any observation type except for `span`, `event` or `generation` in your trace. Then, Langfuse interprets the trace as agentic and will show a graph. The graph is automatically inferred from the observation timings as well as their nesting.
Second, when you use the LangGraph integration the graph automatically shows in Langfuse.

**Observation Types**: See all available [Observation Types](/docs/observability/features/observation-types) and how to set them.
**LangGraph**: See the [LangGraph integration guide](/guides/cookbook/integration_langgraph) for an end-to-end example on how to natively integrate LangGraph with Langfuse for LLM Agent tracing.

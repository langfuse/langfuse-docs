# Comments on Objects

Comments enable teams to add contextual notes and discussions directly to traces, observations, sessions, and prompts within Langfuse. This feature facilitates collaboration by allowing team members to:

- Flag issues or anomalies in specific traces
- Share insights about particular model outputs
- Document edge cases and debugging notes
- Coordinate on prompt improvements
- Leave feedback during development and review cycles

## Supported Object Types

Comments can be added to the following Langfuse objects:

- **Traces** - Comment on complete execution flows
- **Observations** - Add notes to specific LLM calls, spans, or events
- **Sessions** - Discuss user interaction patterns
- **Prompts** - Collaborate on prompt versions and improvements

## Adding Comments

<LangTabs items={["Langfuse UI", "API"]}>

Each supported object page displays a comment button in the interface. The button shows:

- The current comment count (capped at "99+" for readability)
- A disabled state if you don't have read permissions
- An active state when comments are available or you can create them

Clicking the comment button opens a side drawer containing:

1. **Comment Thread** - All existing comments displayed chronologically
2. **Composer** - Text area for writing new comments (if you have write permissions)
3. **Markdown** -  Support basic markdown formatting
4. **@Mentions** - Tag team members in comments using @mentions
5. **Reactions** - Add emoji reactions to comments

<Callout type="info">
  Comment authors can only delete their own comments. Project admins cannot
  delete other users' comments through the UI.
</Callout>

The Comments API allows programmatic access to create and retrieve comments. All endpoints follow the standard Langfuse API patterns.

```http
POST /api/public/comments
```

## @Mentions

You can tag team members in comments using @mentions to notify them about important findings or discussions. This is especially useful when you need someone's attention on a specific trace, observation, or issue.

### How to Use @Mentions

1. Start typing `@` in the comment composer
2. An autocomplete menu appears showing all project members
3. Select a team member from the list or continue typing to filter
4. The mention is inserted into your comment as a clickable badge

### Email Notifications

When you mention someone in a comment:

- They receive an email notification with the comment content and context
- The email includes a direct link to the object (trace, observation, session, or prompt)
- Users can manage their notification preferences per project

### Managing Notification Preferences

Team members can control when they receive email notifications for mentions:

- Navigate to project settings to configure notification preferences
- Choose to enable or disable mention notifications per project
- Preferences apply to all future mentions in that project

<Callout type="info">
  Only project members can be mentioned in comments. The autocomplete menu
  automatically filters to show only users who have access to the current
  project.
</Callout>

## Reactions

Add emoji reactions to comments for quick acknowledgments without writing a full response. Reactions are a lightweight way to show agreement, appreciation, or simply acknowledge that you've seen a comment.

### How to Add Reactions

- Hover over any comment to reveal the reaction button
- Click to select an emoji from the reaction picker
- Your reaction appears next to the comment with your name
- Click your existing reaction again to remove it

Reactions help keep comment threads focused while still allowing team members to provide quick feedback and show engagement with the discussion.

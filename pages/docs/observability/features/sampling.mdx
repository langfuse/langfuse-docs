# Sampling

Sampling can be used to control the volume of traces collected by Langfuse. Sampling is handled client-side.

You can configure the sample rate by setting the `LANGFUSE_SAMPLE_RATE` environment variable or by using the `sample_rate`/`sampleRate` constructor parameter. The value has to be between 0 and 1.

The default value is 1, meaning that all traces are collected. A value of 0.2 means that only 20% of the traces are collected. The SDK samples on the trace level meaning that if a trace is sampled, all observations and scores within that trace will be sampled as well.

With Python SDK v3, you can configure sampling when initializing the client:

```python
from langfuse import Langfuse, get_client
import os

# Method 1: Set environment variable
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SAMPLE_RATE"] = "0.5"  # As string in env var
langfuse = get_client()

# Method 2: Initialize with constructor parameter then get client
Langfuse(sample_rate=0.5)  # 50% of traces will be sampled
langfuse = get_client()
```

When using the `@observe()` decorator:

```python
from langfuse import observe, Langfuse, get_client

# Initialize the client with sampling
Langfuse(sample_rate=0.3)  # 30% of traces will be sampled

@observe()
def process_data():
    # Only ~30% of calls to this function will generate traces
    # The decision is made at the trace level (first span)
    pass
```

If a trace is not sampled, none of its observations (spans or generations) or associated scores will be sent to Langfuse, which can significantly reduce data volume for high-traffic applications.

When using the [`@observe()` decorator](/docs/sdk/python/decorators):

```python
from langfuse.decorators import langfuse_context, observe

os.environ["LANGFUSE_SAMPLE_RATE"] = '0.5'

@observe()
def fn():
    pass

fn()
```

When using the [low-level SDK](/docs/sdk/python/low-level-sdk):

```python
from langfuse import Langfuse

# Either set the environment variable or the constructor parameter. The latter takes precedence.
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SAMPLE_RATE"] = '0.5'
langfuse = Langfuse(sample_rate=0.5)

trace = langfuse.trace(
  name="Rap Battle",
)
```

Langfuse respects OpenTelemetry's sampling decisions. You can configure a sampler in your OTEL SDK to control which traces are sent to Langfuse. This is useful for managing costs and reducing noise in high-volume applications.

Here is an example of how to configure a `TraceIdRatioBasedSampler` to send only 20% of traces:

```ts filename="instrumentation.ts" /new TraceIdRatioBasedSampler(0.2)/
import { NodeSDK } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-node";
import { LangfuseSpanProcessor } from "@langfuse/otel";
import { TraceIdRatioBasedSampler } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base";

const sdk = new NodeSDK({
  // Sample 20% of all traces
  sampler: new TraceIdRatioBasedSampler(0.2),
  spanProcessors: [new LangfuseSpanProcessor()],
});

sdk.start();
```

For more advanced sampling strategies, refer to the [OpenTelemetry JS Sampling Documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/js/sampling/).

# Sampling

Sampling can be used to control the volume of traces collected by Langfuse. Sampling is handled client-side.

You can configure the sample rate by setting the `LANGFUSE_SAMPLE_RATE` environment variable or by using the `sample_rate`/`sampleRate` constructor parameter. The value has to be between 0 and 1.

The default value is 1, meaning that all traces are collected. A value of 0.2 means that only 20% of the traces are collected. The SDK samples on the trace level meaning that if a trace is sampled, all observations and scores within that trace will be sampled as well.

With Python SDK v3, you can configure sampling when initializing the client:

```python
from langfuse import Langfuse, get_client
import os

# Method 1: Set environment variable
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SAMPLE_RATE"] = "0.5"  # As string in env var
langfuse = get_client()

# Method 2: Initialize with constructor parameter then get client
Langfuse(sample_rate=0.5)  # 50% of traces will be sampled
langfuse = get_client()
```

When using the `@observe()` decorator:

```python
from langfuse import observe, Langfuse, get_client

# Initialize the client with sampling
Langfuse(sample_rate=0.3)  # 30% of traces will be sampled

@observe()
def process_data():
    # Only ~30% of calls to this function will generate traces
    # The decision is made at the trace level (first span)
    pass
```

If a trace is not sampled, none of its observations (spans or generations) or associated scores will be sent to Langfuse, which can significantly reduce data volume for high-traffic applications.

When using the [Vercel AI SDK Integration](/integrations/frameworks/vercel-ai-sdk)

```ts filename="instrumentation.ts" {/sampleRate: 0.5/}
import { registerOTel } from "@vercel/otel";
import { LangfuseExporter } from "langfuse-vercel";

export function register() {
  registerOTel({
    serviceName: "langfuse-vercel-ai-nextjs-example",
    traceExporter: new LangfuseExporter({ sampleRate: 0.5 }),
  });
}

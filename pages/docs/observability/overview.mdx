# Observability & Tracing

## What is LLM Observability?

As LLM applications become more complex with multi-step reasoning, tool calls, and context management, understanding what's happening inside your application becomes essential. Observability gives you visibility into every step of an LLM interaction: what models are called, what inputs and outputs are exchanged, how long each step takes, and how much it costs.

Langfuse captures all of this automatically as you build. 

## Understanding Traces, Sessions, and Observations

Langfuse organizes an application's data into three core concepts:

**Traces** represent a single execution through your application. For example, when a user asks a question to a chatbot, that interaction is captured as one trace. Each trace shows you the complete timeline of what happened under the hood.

**Sessions** group related traces together. This is useful for applications involving multi-turn conversations or multi-step workflows. For example, achatbot conversation with three back-and-forth messages would be one session containing three traces.

**Observations** are the individual steps within a trace. These include LLM generations, toolcalls, etc. Observations can be nested.

## Built on OpenTelemetry

Langfuse is based on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), an open standard for collecting telemetry data from applications. This means you can use any OpenTelemetry-compatible instrumentation library to send data to Langfuse, and you can also send your Langfuse data to other platforms. You're not locked in: your instrumentation code remains portable and vendor-neutral.

## How to get the most out of tracing

Start by [setting up your first trace](/docs/observability/get-started). After that, the following features will help you get the most out of tracing:

#### Tracking token usage and costs

Langfuse automatically tracks token usage and calculates costs for all major model providers. You can create custom dashboards to visualize spending patterns by model, user, or feature. See the [token and cost tracking documentation](/docs/observability/features/token-and-cost-tracking) for details on custom pricing and cost analysis.

#### Sessions for multi-turn applications

Use sessions to group related traces and understand the full context of conversations or workflows. This makes it easier to debug issues that span multiple interactions. Learn more in the [sessions documentation](/docs/observability/features/sessions).

#### Prompt management

When you use Langfuse's prompt management, traces automatically link to the prompt version that was used. This way you can compare metrics across prompt versions and understand the impact of changes immediately. Learn how to start [using prompt management here](/docs/prompt-management/get-started).

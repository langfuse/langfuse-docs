# Observability & Tracing

## What is LLM Observability?

As LLM applications become more complex with multi-step reasoning, tool calls, and context management, understanding what's happening inside your application becomes essential. Observability gives you visibility into every step of an LLM interaction: what models are called, what inputs and outputs are exchanged, how long each step takes, and how much it costs.

Langfuse captures all of this automatically as you build.

## Built on OpenTelemetry

Langfuse is based on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), an open standard for collecting telemetry data from applications. This means you can use any OpenTelemetry-compatible instrumentation library to send data to Langfuse, and you can also send your Langfuse data to other platforms. You're not locked in: your instrumentation code remains portable and vendor-neutral.

## Getting started

Start by [setting up your first trace](/docs/observability/get-started).

Take a moment to understand the core concepts of tracing in Langfuse: [traces, sessions, and observations](/docs/observability/data-model).

Once you're up and running, you can start adding on more functionality to your traces. We recommend starting with the following:
- [Grouping traces into sessions for multi-turn applications](/docs/observability/features/sessions)
- [Splitting traces into environments for different stages of your application](/docs/observability/features/environments)
- [Adding attributes to your traces so you can filter them in the future](/docs/observability/features/tags)

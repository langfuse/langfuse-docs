title: LLM Observability & Application Tracing (open source)
description: Open Source LLM Observability and Tracing with Langfuse. Integrates with OpenAI, LlamaIndex, LangChain, Python Decorators and more.

# Observability & Tracing

Langfuse is a platform for observability and tracing of LLM applications. It captures everything happening during an LLM interaction: inputs, outputs, tool usage, retries, latencies and costs.

**Observability** is the broader concept of understanding what is happening under the hood of you LLM application. **Traces** are the Langfuse object used to achieve deep observability.

## Why Tracing?

- Faster development & debugging, understand how the LLM/agent is behaving
- Cost tracking for each model call
- Reduce application latency
- Set foundation for evaluations
- Save hours in customer support

## Why Trace with Langfuse?

- Open Source: Langfuse is the fastest growing open source LLM observability platform.
- Multi-Modal: Langfuse supports text, images, audio, and more.
- Multi-Model: Langfuse supports all major LLM providers.
- Framework Agnostic: Langfuse supports LangChain, OpenAI, LlamaIndex, and more.
- Language Agnostic: Langfuse supports Python, JavaScript, and more.

{/* I actually think we should remove the shallow feature videos here, we will have a page with all these videos so users can experience highlevel functionality in a visual way - midterm we sill probably have marketing landing pages for each feature */}

# Langfuse SDKs

The Langfuse SDKs are the recommended way to integrate with Langfuse for custom instrumentation.

Properties:

- Based on OpenTelemetry, so you can use any OTEL-based instrumentation library for your LLM.
- Fully async requests, using Langfuse adds almost no latency
- Accurate latency tracking using synchronous timestamps
- IDs available for downstream use
- Great DX when nesting observations
- Cannot break your application, all errors are caught and logged
- Interoperable with Langfuse [integrations](/integrations)

Please see our [Python SDK documentation](/docs/observability/sdk/python/overview) on how to get started.

## JS/TS

import JSSDKPackages from "@/components-mdx/js-sdk-packages.mdx";

Please see our [TypeScript SDK documentation](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/overview) on how to get started.

## Other Languages

Via the public API, you can integrate with Langfuse from any language.

For tracing, use the OpenTelemetry SDK of your choice and send traces to the [Langfuse OTel Endpoint](/integrations/native/opentelemetry).

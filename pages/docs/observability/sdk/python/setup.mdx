# Setup

To get started with the Langfuse Python SDK, you need to install the SDK and initialize the client.

<Steps>
## Installation

To install the Langfuse Python SDK, run:

```bash
pip install langfuse
```

## Initialize Client

Begin by initializing the `Langfuse` client. You must provide your Langfuse public and secret keys. These can be passed as constructor arguments or set as environment variables (recommended).

If you are self-hosting Langfuse or using a data region other than the default (EU, `https://cloud.langfuse.com`), ensure you configure the `host` argument or the `LANGFUSE_HOST` environment variable (recommended).

<Tabs items={["via Environment Variables (recommended)", "via Constructor Arguments"]}>
<Tab>
```bash filename=".env"
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="pk-lf-..."
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="sk-lf-..."
LANGFUSE_HOST="https://cloud.langfuse.com" # US region: https://us.cloud.langfuse.com
```

</Tab>

<Tab>

```python filename="Initialize client"
from langfuse import Langfuse

# Initialize with constructor arguments

langfuse = Langfuse(
    public_key="YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY",
    secret_key="YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
    host="https://cloud.langfuse.com" # US region: https://us.cloud.langfuse.com
)
```

If you are reinstantiating Langfuse client with different constructor arguments but the same `public_key`, the client will reuse the same instance and ignore the new arguments.

Verify connection with `langfuse.auth_check()`
</summary>

You can also verify your connection to the Langfuse server using `langfuse.auth_check()`. We do not recommend using this in production as this adds latency to your application.

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()

# Verify connection, do not use in production as this is a synchronous call
if langfuse.auth_check():
    print("Langfuse client is authenticated and ready!")
else:
    print("Authentication failed. Please check your credentials and host.")
```

## Accessing the Client Globally

The Langfuse client is a singleton. It can be accessed anywhere in your application using the `get_client` function.

Optionally, you can initialize the client via `Langfuse()` to pass in configuration options (see above). Otherwise, it is created automatically when you call `get_client()` based on environment variables.

```python
from langfuse import get_client

# Optionally, initialize the client with configuration options
# langfuse = Langfuse(public_key="pk-lf-...", secret_key="sk-lf-...")

# Get the default client
client = get_client()
```

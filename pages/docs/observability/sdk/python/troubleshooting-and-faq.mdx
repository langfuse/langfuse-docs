## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Issues**:
  - Ensure `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, and `LANGFUSE_HOST` (if not using default cloud) are correctly set either as environment variables or in the `Langfuse()` constructor.
  - Use `langfuse.auth_check()` after initialization to verify credentials. Do not use this in production as this method waits for a response from the server.
- **No Traces Appearing**:
  - Check if `tracing_enabled` is `True` (default).
  - Verify `sample_rate` is not `0.0`.
  - Ensure `langfuse.shutdown()` is called or the program exits cleanly to allow `atexit` hooks to flush data. Manually call `langfuse.flush()` to force data sending.
  - Enable debug logging (`debug=True` or `LANGFUSE_DEBUG="True"`) to see SDK activity and potential errors during exporting.
- **Incorrect Nesting or Missing Spans**:
  - Ensure you are using context managers (`with langfuse.start_as_current_span(...)`) for proper context propagation.
  - If manually creating spans (`langfuse.start_span()`), ensure they are correctly ended with `.end()`.
  - In async code, ensure context is not lost across `await` boundaries if not using Langfuse's async-compatible methods.
- **Langchain/OpenAI Integration Not Working**:
  - Confirm the respective integration (e.g., `from langfuse.openai import openai` or `LangfuseCallbackHandler`) is correctly set up _before_ the calls to the LLM libraries are made.
  - Check for version compatibility issues between Langfuse, Langchain, and OpenAI SDKs.
- **Media Not Appearing**:
  - Ensure `LangfuseMedia` objects are correctly initialized and passed in `input`, `output`, or `metadata`.
  - Check debug logs for any media upload errors. Media uploads happen in background threads.

If you encounter persistent issues, please:

1.  Enable debug logging to gather more information.
2.  Check the Langfuse status page (if applicable for cloud users).
3.  Raise an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/issues) with details about your setup, SDK version, code snippets, and debug logs.

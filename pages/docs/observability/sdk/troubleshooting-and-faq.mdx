# Troubleshooting & FAQ

If you cannot find your issue below, try [Ask AI](/docs/ask-ai), open a [GitHub issue](/issues), or contact [support](/support).

## Authentication issues

- Ensure `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, and `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` are set as environment variables or passed to `Langfuse()` as constructor arguments.
- Use `langfuse.auth_check()` during setup (not in production) to confirm connectivity.

## No traces appearing

- See [Missing traces](/faq/all/missing-traces) for common reasons and solutions.
- Confirm `tracing_enabled` is `True` and `sample_rate` is not `0.0`.
- Call `langfuse.shutdown()` (or `langfuse.flush()` in short-lived jobs) so queued data is exported.
- Enable debug logging (`debug=True` or `LANGFUSE_DEBUG="True"` on Python, `LANGFUSE_DEBUG="true"` or `LANGFUSE_LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"` on JS/TS) to inspect exporter output.

## Incorrect nesting or missing spans

- Self-hosted users need Langfuse platform **>= 3.63.0** for the OTel based SDKs.
- Prefer context managers (`with langfuse.start_as_current_observation(...)`) to maintain OTEL context.
- If using manual spans (`langfuse.start_observation()`), always call `.end()`.
- In async code, rely on Langfuse helpers to avoid losing context across `await` boundaries.

## LangChain/OpenAI integration issues

- Ensure Langfuse wrappers (`from langfuse.openai import openai` or `LangfuseCallbackHandler`) are instantiated before API calls.
- Check version compatibility between Langfuse, LangChain, and the model SDKs.

## Media not appearing

- Use `LangfuseMedia` objects for audio/image payloads and inspect debug logs to surface upload errors (uploads run on background threads).

## Missing traces with `@vercel/otel`

- Use the manual OpenTelemetry setup via `NodeSDK` and register the `LangfuseSpanProcessor`. The `@vercel/otel` helper does not yet support the OpenTelemetry JS SDK v2 that Langfuse depends on. See the [TypeScript instrumentation docs](/docs/observability/sdk/instrumentation#framework-third-party-telemetry) for a full example.

# TypeScript SDK - Overview

The modular Langfuse TypeScript SDK (v4) is built on **[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)** for robust observability, better context management, and easy integration with third-party libraries.

<Callout type="info">
This documentation is for the TypeScript SDK v4. If you are looking for the documentation for the TypeScript SDK v3, please [click here]().
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
If you are self-hosting Langfuse, the TypeScript SDK v4 requires **Langfuse platform version ≥ 3.95.0** for all features to work correctly.
</Callout>

## Quickstart

Get your first trace into Langfuse in just a few minutes.

### Install packages

Install the relevant packages to get started with tracing:

```bash
npm install @langfuse/tracing @langfuse/otel @opentelemetry/sdk-node
```

Learn more about the packages [here](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/overview#packages).

### Set up environment variables

import EnvJS from "@/components-mdx/env-js.mdx";

Add your Langfuse credentials to your environment variables. Make sure that you have a `.env` file in your project root and a package like `dotenv` to load the variables.

<EnvJS />

### Set up OpenTelemetry

Create a file named `instrumentation.ts` to initialize the OpenTelemetry SDK. The **`LangfuseSpanProcessor`** is the key component that sends traces to Langfuse.

```ts filename="instrumentation.ts" /LangfuseSpanProcessor/
import { NodeSDK } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-node";
import { LangfuseSpanProcessor } from "@langfuse/otel";

const sdk = new NodeSDK({
  spanProcessors: [new LangfuseSpanProcessor()],
});

sdk.start();
```

Import the `instrumentation.ts` file at the very top of your application's entry point (e.g., `index.ts`).

```ts filename="index.ts"
import "./instrumentation"; // Must be the first import
```

Learn more about setting up OpenTelemetry [here](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/setup).

### Instrument your application

Use the `startActiveObservation` function to start a trace. This function takes a callback and automatically manages the observation's lifecycle and the OpenTelemetry context. Any observation created inside the callback will automatically be nested under the active observation, and the observation will be ended when the callback finishes.

```ts filename="index.ts" /startActiveObservation/
import "./instrumentation";
import { startActiveObservation } from "@langfuse/tracing";

async function main() {
  await startActiveObservation("my-first-trace", async (span) => {
    span.update({
      input:  "Hello, Langfuse!",
      output: "This is my first trace!",
    });
  });
}

main();
```

Learn more about instrumenting your application [here](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/instrumentation).

### Run your application

Execute your application. You should see your trace appear in the Langfuse UI.

```bash
npx tsx index.ts
```

## Packages

The Langfuse SDK is designed to be modular. Here's an overview of the available packages:

| Package | Description | Environment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`@langfuse/core`** | Core utilities, types, and logger shared across packages. | Universal JS |
| **`@langfuse/client`** | Client for features like prompts, datasets, and scores. | Universal JS |
| **`@langfuse/tracing`** | Core OpenTelemetry-based tracing functions (`startSpan`, etc.). | Universal JS |
| **`@langfuse/otel`** | The `LangfuseSpanProcessor` to export traces to Langfuse. | Node.js ≥ 20 |
| **`@langfuse/openai`** | Automatic tracing integration for the OpenAI SDK. | Universal JS |
| **`@langfuse/langchain`** | CallbackHandler for tracing LangChain applications. | Universal JS |

## OpenTelemetry foundation

Building on OpenTelemetry is a core design choice for this SDK. It offers several key advantages:

- **Standardization**: It aligns with the industry standard for observability, making it easier to integrate with existing monitoring and APM tools.
- **Robust Context Management**: OpenTelemetry provides reliable context propagation, ensuring that traces are correctly linked even in complex, asynchronous applications.
- **Ecosystem & Interoperability**: You can leverage a vast ecosystem of third-party instrumentations. If a library you use supports OpenTelemetry, its traces can be sent to Langfuse automatically.

# TypeScript SDK - Setup

## Installation

The Langfuse TypeScript SDK is modular, so you can install only the packages you need.


### Full Tracing install

Install the relevant packages for a full tracing setup:

```bash
npm install @langfuse/tracing @langfuse/otel @opentelemetry/sdk-node
```

- **`@langfuse/tracing`**: Core tracing functions (`startObservation`, `startActiveObservation`, etc.)
- **`@langfuse/otel`**: The `LangfuseSpanProcessor` to export traces to Langfuse.
- **`@opentelemetry/sdk-node`**: The OpenTelemetry SDK for Node.js.

Learn more about the packages [here](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/overview#packages).


### Client-only  install

If you do not use Langfuse tracing in your application and rely on features such as prompt management, you only need the `@langfuse/client` package.

```bash
npm install @langfuse/client
```

## Register your credentials

import EnvJS from "@/components-mdx/env-js.mdx";

Add your Langfuse credentials to your environment variables. Make sure that you have a `.env` file in your project root and a package like `dotenv` to load the variables.

<EnvJS />

## Initialize OpenTelemetry

The Langfuse TypeScript SDK's tracing is built on top of OpenTelemetry, so you need to set up the OpenTelemetry SDK. The `LangfuseSpanProcessor` is the key component that sends traces to Langfuse.

```ts filename="instrumentation.ts" /LangfuseSpanProcessor/
import { NodeSDK } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-node";
import { LangfuseSpanProcessor } from "@langfuse/otel";

const sdk = new NodeSDK({
  spanProcessors: [new LangfuseSpanProcessor()],
});

sdk.start();
```

The `LangfuseSpanProcessor` is the key component that sends traces to Langfuse.

For advanced configuration of the LangfuseSpanProcessor for masking, filtering, and more, see [Advanced Configuration](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/advanced-configuration).

You can learn more about setting up OpenTelemetry in your JS environment [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/js/getting-started/nodejs/).

<Callout type="info">
**Next.js users:**

If you are using Next.js, please use the OpenTelemetry setup via the `NodeSDK` described above rather than via `registerOTel` from `@vercel/otel`. This is because [the `@vercel/otel` package does not yet support the OpenTelemetry JS SDK v2](https://github.com/vercel/otel/issues/154) on which the `@langfuse/tracing` and `@langfuse/otel` packages are based.

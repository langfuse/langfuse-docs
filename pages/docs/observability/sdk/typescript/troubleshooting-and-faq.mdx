# TypeScript SDK - Troubleshooting and FAQ

If your issue is not covered here, please see our [support page](/support).


## Missing traces in serverless environments

Please see the documentation on [force-flushing](/docs/observability/sdk/typescript/advanced-configuration#force-flushing-events)

## Missing traces with `@vercel/otel`

If you are using Next.js, please use the OpenTelemetry setup via the `NodeSDK` described above rather than via `registerOTel` from `@vercel/otel`. This is because [the `@vercel/otel` package does not yet support the OpenTelemetry JS SDK v2](https://github.com/vercel/otel/issues/154) on which the `@langfuse/tracing` and `@langfuse/otel` packages are based.

# Troubleshooting and FAQ

## Event queuing/batching [#queuing-batching]

Langfuse's client SDKs and integrations are all designed to queue and batch requests in the background to optimize API calls and network time. Batches are determined by a combination of time and size (number of events and size of batch).

### Configuration

All integrations have a sensible default configuration, but you can customize the batching behaviour to suit your needs.

| Option (Python) [SDK constructor, Environment]  | Option (JS)          | Description                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flush_at`, `LANGFUSE_FLUSH_AT`                 | `flushAt`            | The maximum number of events to batch up before sending. |
| `flush_interval`, `LANGFUSE_FLUSH_INTERVAL` (s) | `flushInterval` (ms) | The maximum time to wait before sending a batch.         |

You can e.g. set `flushAt=1` to send every event immediately, or `flushInterval=1000` to send every second.

### Manual flushing

<Callout type="info">
  This is especially relevant for short-lived applications like serverless
  functions. If you do not flush the client, you may lose events.
</Callout>

If you want to send a batch immediately, you can call the `flush` method on the client. In case of network issues, flush will log an error and retry the batch, it will never throw an exception.

<Tab>
{/* Python SDK v3 */}

```python
from langfuse import get_client

# access the client directly

langfuse = get_client()

# Flush all pending observations

langfuse.flush()

```

If you exit the application, use `shutdown` method to make sure all requests are flushed and pending requests are awaited before the process exits. On success of this function, no more events will be sent to Langfuse API.

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()

langfuse.shutdown()
```

</Tab>

<Tab>
{/* Python SDK v2 */}

```python
# Decorator
from langfuse.decorators import langfuse_context
langfuse_context.flush()

# low-level SDK
langfuse.flush()
```

If you exit the application, use `shutdown` method to make sure all requests are flushed and pending requests are awaited before the process exits. On success of this function, no more events will be sent to Langfuse API.

```python
langfuse.shutdown()
```

</Tab>
<Tab>
{/* JS/TS */}

```javascript
await langfuse.flushAsync();
```

If you exit the application, use `shutdownAsync` method to make sure all requests are flushed and pending requests are awaited before the process exits.

```javascript
await langfuse.shutdownAsync();
```

**If you run on Vercel**, the [`waitUntil()`](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/functions-api-reference#waituntil) method enqueues an asynchronous task to be performed during the lifecycle of the request. It doesn't block the response, but should complete before shutting down the function. Thereby, it ensures that all events are flushed before the function exits without delaying the response.

```sh
npm i @vercel/functions
```

```javascript
import { waitUntil } from "@vercel/functions";

export async function POST(req, res) {
  // your code involving langfuse

  // Flush events to Langfuse without blocking the response
  waitUntil(langfuse.flushAsync());

  // Send response to client
  return res.status(200).send("OK");
}
```

<Tab>
{/* OpenAI SDK (Python) */}
For Python SDK v3

```python
from langfuse import get_client

# access the client directly
langfuse = get_client()

# Flush all pending observations
langfuse.flush()

from langfuse.openai import openai
openai.flush_langfuse()

{/* Langchain (Python) */}
For Python SDK v3

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()

langfuse.flush()

# access the client directly
langfuse_handler.client.flush()

```

For Python SDK v2

```python
langfuse_handler.flush()
```

</Tab>
<Tab>
{/* Langchain (JS) */}

```javascript
await langfuseHandler.flushAsync();
```

If you exit the application, use `shutdownAsync` method to make sure all requests are flushed and pending requests are awaited before the process exits.

```javascript
await langfuseHandler.shutdownAsync();
```

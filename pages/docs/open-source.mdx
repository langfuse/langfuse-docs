# Open Source

Langfuse is open source for the following reasons:

- To establish complete transparency
- To enable the community to [self-host](/docs/deployment/self-host) and contribute [changes](/issue) they wish to implement
- To collaborate on integrations with various tools and frameworks
- To assure users that Langfuse is open and does not impose lock-in, and that production traces are user data that can be exported/fetched at any time

## Self-host vs Cloud

Langfuse can be used [locally](/docs/deployment/local) and [self-hosted](/docs/deployment/self-host) with ease. The core team also provides [Langfuse cloud](/docs/deployment/cloud) as a managed solution to simplify the initial setup of Langfuse and to minimize the operational overhead of maintaining high availability in production.

## License

Langfuse is licensed under an [MIT license](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/main/LICENSE), with the exception of the `/ee` folder of the repository, if applicable.

Currently, our focus is entirely on open source. However, we may consider commercializing premium features as part of an enterprise version in the future. For specific requirements, please contact us at enterprise@langfuse.com

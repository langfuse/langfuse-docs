# Open source

`Langfuse` is open source to

- establish full transparency
- enable the community to [self-host](/docs/self-host)
- collaborate on integrations with other tools and frameworks.

## Self-host vs cloud

`Langfuse` is simple to use [locally](/docs/local) and possible [self-host](/docs/self-host). The core team offers [Langfuse cloud](/docs/cloud) as a managed solution to make it easier to get started with Langfuse and reduce the operational overhead of running it with high availability in production.

## License

`Langfuse` is available under an [MIT license](https://github.com/finto-technologies/langfuse/blob/main/LICENSE), except for the `/ee` folder of the repository, if applicable.

We are currently focusing 100% of our energy on the open source part. We may in the future consider commercializing premium features as part of an enterprise version. Please reach out to us if you have specific requirements: enterprise@langfuse.com

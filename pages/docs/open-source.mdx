# Open source

Langfuse is open source to

- establish full transparency
- enable the community to [self-host](/docs/deployment/self-host) and contribute [changes](/issue) they'd like to see
- collaborate on integrations with other tools and frameworks
- make a strong commitment that Langfuse is open and does not lock you in, production traces are your data and you can export/fetch them at any time

## Self-host vs cloud

Langfuse is simple to use [locally](/docs/deployment/local) and [self-hosted](/docs/deployment/self-host). The core team offers [Langfuse cloud](/docs/deployment/cloud) as a managed solution to make it easier to get started with Langfuse and reduce the operational overhead of running it with high availability in production.

## License

Langfuse is available under an [MIT license](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/main/LICENSE), except for the `/ee` folder of the repository, if applicable.

We are currently focusing 100% of our energy on the open source part. We may in the future consider commercializing premium features as part of an enterprise version. Please reach out to us if you have specific requirements: enterprise@langfuse.com

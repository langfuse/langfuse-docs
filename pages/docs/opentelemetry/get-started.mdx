[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is a [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) project that provides a set of specifications, APIs, libraries that define a standard way to collect distributed traces and metrics from your application.

Langfuse can operate as an OpenTelemetry Backend to receive traces on the `/api/public/otel` (OTLP) endpoint. In addition to the [Langfuse SDKs](/docs/sdk/overview) and [native integrations](/docs/integrations/overview), this OpenTelemetry endpoint is designed to increase compatibility with frameworks, libraries, and languages beyond the SDKs and native integrations. Popular OpenTelemetry libraries include OpenLLMetry and OpenLIT which extend Language support of Langfuse tracing to Java and Go and cover frameworks such as AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, and more.

As the [Semantic Conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/gen-ai/) for GenAI attributes on traces are still evolving, Langfuse maps the received OTel traces to the [Langfuse data model](/docs/tracing-data-model) and supports additional attributes that are popular in the OTel GenAI ecosystem ([property mapping](#property-mapping)). Please contribute to the discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/2509) if an integration does not work as expected or does not parse the correct attributes.

## OpenTelemetry endpoint

Langfuse can receive traces on the `/api/public/otel` (OTLP) endpoint.

If you use a Collector that uses the OpenTelemetry SDK to export traces, you can use the following configuration:

```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/otel" # EU data region
# OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://us.cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/otel" # US data region

OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Basic ${AUTH_STRING}"
```

<Callout type="info">

Langfuse uses [Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) to authenticate requests.

You can use the following command to get the base64 encoded API keys (referred to as `AUTH_STRING`): `echo -n "pk-lf-1234567890:sk-lf-1234567890" | base64`

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">

If your collector requires signal-specific environment variables, the trace endpoint is `/api/public/otel/v1/traces`.

```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT="https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/otel/v1/traces" # EU data region
# OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT="https://us.cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/otel/v1/traces" # US data region
```

</Callout>

## Custom via OpenTelemetry SDKs

You can use the OpenTelemetry SDKs to directly export traces to Langfuse with the configuration mentioned above. Thereby, Language support of Langfuse is extended to other languages than the ones supported by the [Langfuse SDKs](/docs/sdk/overview) (Python and JS/TS).

As a reference, see [this example notebook](/docs/opentelemetry/example-python-sdk) on how to use the OpenTelemetry Python SDK to export traces to Langfuse.

## Use OpenTelemetry GenAI Instrumentation Libraries

Any OpenTelemetry compatible instrumentation can be used to export traces to Langfuse. Check out the following end-to-end examples of popular instrumentation SDKs to get started:

## Property Mapping [#property-mapping]

<Callout type="info">

Please [raise an issue on GitHub](/issues) if an integration does not work as expected or does not parse the correct attributes.

</Callout>

Langfuse accepts any span that adheres to the OpenTelemetry specification.
In addition, we map many GenAI specific properties to properties in the Langfuse data model to provide a seamless experience when using OpenTelemetry with Langfuse.
First and foremost, we stick to the [OpenTelemetry Gen AI Conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/gen-ai/), but also map vendor specific properties from common frameworks.
All attributes and resourceAttributes are available within the Langfuse `metadata` property as a fallback.

Below, we share a non-exhaustive list of mappings that Langfuse applies:

| OpenTelemetry Attribute       | Langfuse Property   | Description                                                                                                                                                      |

| `gen_ai.usage.*`              | `usageDetails.*`    | Maps all keys within [usage](/docs/model-usage-and-cost) aside from `cost` to `usageDetails`. Token properties are simplified to `input`, `output`, and `total`. |
| `llm.token_count.*`           | `usageDetails.*`    | Maps all keys within [usage](/docs/model-usage-and-cost) to `usageDetails`. Token properties are simplified to `input`, `output`, and `total`.                   |

| `gen_ai.request.*`            | `modelParameters`   | Maps all keys within request to `modelParameters`.                                                                                                               |

| `langfuse.session.id`         | `sessionId`         | The [session ID](/docs/tracing-features/sessions) for the request.                                                                                               |

# LLM Analytics

Langfuse analytics derives actionable insights from [production traces](/docs/tracing).

## Metrics

- **Quality** is measured through user feedback, model-based scoring, human-in-the-loop scored samples or custom scores via SDKs/API (see [scores](/docs/scores/overview)). Quality is assessed over time as well as across prompt versions, LLMs and users.
- **Cost and Latency** are accurately measured and broken down by user, session, geography, feature, model and prompt version.
- **Volume** based on the ingested traces and tokens used.

## Dimensions

Analytics is incrementally adoptable based on the data you send to Langfuse. The following dimensions are available:

- Trace name: differentiate between different use cases, features, etc. by adding a `name` field to your traces.
- User: track usage and cost by user. Just add a `userId` to your traces ([docs](/docs/tracing-features/users)).
- Tags: filter different use cases, features, etc. by adding [tags](/docs/tracing-features/tags) to your traces.
- Release and version numbers: track how changes to the LLM application affected your metrics.

## Feedback

We are continuously adding new charts to the dashboard. If you have any feedback or requests, please create a [GitHub Issue](/issue) or share your idea with the community on [Discord](/discord).

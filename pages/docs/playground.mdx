# LLM playground
<Callout type="info">This feature is available for Langfuse cloud users only.</Callout>

With the LLM playground, you can now test and iterate your prompts directly in Langfuse. Either start from scratch or jump into the playground from an existing prompt in your project. You can then tweak the prompt and the model parameters to see how the model responds to different inputs. This way, you can quickly iterate on your prompts and fine-tune them to get the best results for your LLM app. 


## How it works

The LLM playground currently supports all major models from both OpenAI and Anthropic, and we're planning on adding more model providers in the future. Check out the video below to see the LLM playground in action.

# Prompt Folders

Prompt folders help you organize your prompts into logical groups. As your prompt library grows, folders keep related prompts together — by feature, team, environment, or any structure that makes sense for your workflow.

Prompts can be organized into virtual folders to group prompts with similar purposes.
To create a folder, add slashes (`/`) to a prompt name. The UI shows every segment ending with a `/` as a folder automatically.

**Note**: accessing prompts in folders via the Python SDK requires `langfuse >= 3.0.2`.

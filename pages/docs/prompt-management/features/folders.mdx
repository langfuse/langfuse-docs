# Prompt Folders

Prompts can be organized into virtual folders to group prompts with similar purposes.
To create a folder, add slashes (`/`) to a prompt name. The UI shows every segment ending with a `/` as a folder automatically.

<Callout type="info">

**Note**: accessing prompts in folders via the Python SDK requires `langfuse >= 3.0.2`.

**URL Encoding**: When using SDK methods like `.get_prompt(...)`, you don't have to URI encode the prompt name. When directly accessing the underlying API client (calls like: `.api.promptsGet(...)`), you have to URI encode the prompt name berfore passing it to the function.

## Create a folder

Use the Langfuse UI to create a folder by adding a slash (`/`) to a prompt name.

# Link Prompts to Traces

Linking prompts to [traces](/docs/observability) enables tracking of metrics and evaluations per prompt version. It's the foundation of improving prompt quality over time.

After linking prompts and traces, navigating to a generation span in Langfuse will highlight the prompt that was used to generate the response. To access the metrics, navigate to your prompt and click on the `Metrics` tab.

# LLM Playground

Test and iterate on your prompts directly in the Langfuse Prompt Playground. Tweak the prompt and model parameters to see how different models respond to these input changes. This allows you to quickly iterate on your prompts and optimize them for the best results in your LLM app without having to switch between tools or use any code.

### Tool calling and structured outputs

The Langfuse Playground supports tool calling and structured output schemas, enabling you to define, test, and validate LLM executions that rely on tool calls and enforce specific response formats.

**Tool Calling**

- Define custom tools with JSON schema definitions
- Test prompts relying on tools in real-time by mocking tool responses
- Save tool definitions to your project

**Structured Output**

- Enforce response formats using JSON schemas
- Save schemas to your project
- Jump into the playground from your OpenAI generation using structured output

### Add prompt variables

You can add prompt variables in the playground to simulate different inputs to your prompt.

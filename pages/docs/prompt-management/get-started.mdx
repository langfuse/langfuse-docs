# Get Started with Prompt Management

This guide walks you through creating and using your a prompt with Langfuse. If you’re looking to understand what prompt management is and why it matters, check out the [Prompt Management Overview](/docs/prompt-management/overview) first. For details on how prompts are structured in Langfuse and how it works in the background, see [Core Concepts](/docs/prompt-management/data-model).

<Steps>

### Get API keys

1.  [Create Langfuse account](https://cloud.langfuse.com/auth/sign-up) or [self-host Langfuse](/self-hosting).
2.  Create new API credentials in the project settings.

### Create a prompt [#create-update-prompt]

import PromptCreate from "@/components-mdx/prompt-create.mdx";

<PromptCreate />

### Use prompt [#use-prompt]

import PromptUse from "@/components-mdx/prompt-use.mdx";

<PromptUse />

</Steps>

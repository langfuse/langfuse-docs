# Prompt Management

Prompt management is a systematic approach to storing, versioning, and retrieving prompts for your LLM application. Instead of hardcoding prompts in your application code, you manage them centrally in Langfuse.

### Decouple Prompt Updates from Code Deployment

In most LLM applications, **prompt iteration and code deployment** are managed by **different people**. Product managers and domain experts iterate on prompts, while engineers manage deployments.

With prompts in code, a simple text change requires engineering involvement, code review, and a full deployment cycle, turning a 2-minute update into hours or days of waiting.

When prompts live in Langfuse, non-technical team members update them directly in the UI while your application automatically fetches the latest version. This **separation of concerns** means **prompt updates deploy instantly**, without needing to involve engineering or triggering a deployment.

### No latency, no availability risk

**Langfuse Prompt Management adds no latency to your application**. Prompts are cached client-side by the SDK, so retrieving them is as fast as reading from memory. See [the caching docs page](/docs/prompt-management/features/caching) for more details.



## Getting started

Start by [adding your first prompt](/docs/prompt-management/get-started) to Langfuse, and connecting it to your application. You can either create a prompt from scratch in the UI or import existing prompts from your application.

Take a moment to understand the core concepts: [prompt types, versioning, labels, and configuration](/docs/prompt-management/data-model).

Once you have prompts in Langfuse and are using them in your application, there are a few things you can do to get the most out of Langfuse Prompt Management:
- [Link prompts to traces](/docs/prompt-management/features/link-to-traces) to analyze performance by prompt version
- [Use version control and labels](/docs/prompt-management/features/prompt-version-control) to manage deployments across environments

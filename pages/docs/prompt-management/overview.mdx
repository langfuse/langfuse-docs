# Prompt Management

Prompt management is a systematic approach to storing, versioning, and retrieving prompts for your LLM application. Instead of hardcoding prompts in your application code, you manage them centrally in Langfuse.

The key benefit is decoupling: you can edit prompts without redeploying your application. This means product managers and domain experts can iterate on prompts through the UI, test changes in the playground, and deploy updates instantly—without involving developers or going through a deployment cycle.

**Langfuse Prompt Management adds no latency to your application**. Prompts are cached client-side by the SDK, so retrieving them is as fast as reading from memory. See [the caching docs page](/docs/prompt-management/features/caching) for more details.

## Getting started

Start by [adding your first prompt](/docs/prompt-management/get-started) to Langfuse, and connecting it to your application. You can either create a prompt from scratch in the UI or import existing prompts from your application.

Take a moment to understand the core concepts: [prompt types, versioning, labels, and configuration](/docs/prompt-management/data-model).

Once you have prompts in Langfuse and are using them in your application, there are a few things you can do to get the most out of Langfuse Prompt Management:
- [Link prompts to traces](/docs/prompt-management/features/link-to-traces) to analyze performance by prompt version
- [Use version control and labels](/docs/prompt-management/features/prompt-version-control) to manage deployments across environments

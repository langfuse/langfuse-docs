# MCP Server for Langfuse Prompts

The Langfuse Prompt [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) (MCP) Server enables seamless integration between Langfuse's [Prompt Management](/docs/prompts/get-started) and LLM Agent systems. This server acts as a bridge, making collaboratively managed prompts easily accessible to AI agents and applications.

The MCP Server is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/langfuse/mcp-server-langfuse).

## Demo

This is a brief demo of the Langfuse Prompt MCP Server in action in Claude Desktop.

## Features

### MCP Prompt

This server implements the [MCP Prompts specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/prompts) for prompt discovery and retrieval.

- `prompts/list`: List all available prompts

  - Optional cursor-based pagination
  - Returns prompt names and their required arguments, limitation: all arguments are assumed to be optional and do not include descriptions as variables do not have specification in Langfuse
  - Includes next cursor for pagination if there's more than 1 page of prompts

- `prompts/get`: Get a specific prompt

  - Transforms Langfuse prompts (text and chat) into MCP prompt objects
  - Compiles prompt with provided variables

### Tools

To increase compatibility with other MCP clients that do not support the prompt capability, the server also exports tools that replicate the functionality of the MCP Prompts.

- `get-prompts`: List available prompts

  - Optional `cursor` parameter for pagination
  - Returns a list of prompts with their arguments

- `get-prompt`: Retrieve and compile a specific prompt
  - Required `name` parameter: Name of the prompt to retrieve
  - Optional `arguments` parameter: JSON object with prompt variables

## Usage

<Steps>

### Clone & Build MCP Server

Repo: [mcp-server-langfuse](https://github.com/langfuse/mcp-server-langfuse)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/mcp-server-langfuse.git

cd mcp-server-langfuse
npm install
npm run build
```

### Add Server in MCP Client

<Tabs items={["Claude Desktop", "Cursor"]}>

<Tab>

Configure [Claude for Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) by editing `claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "langfuse": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["<absolute-path>/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY": "your-public-key",
        "LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY": "your-secret-key",
        "LANGFUSE_BASEURL": "https://cloud.langfuse.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace the environment variables with your actual Langfuse API keys. The server will now be available to use in Claude Desktop.

</Tab>

<Tab>

Add new MCP Server in Cursor settings:

- Name: `Langfuse Prompts`
- Type: `command`
- Command:
  ```bash
  LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="your-public-key" LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key" LANGFUSE_BASEURL="https://cloud.langfuse.com" node absolute-path/build/index.js
  ```

Make sure to replace the environment variables with your actual Langfuse API keys. The server will now be available to use in Cursor.

## Limitations

The MCP Server is a work in progress and has some limitations:

- Only prompts with a `production` label in Langfuse are returned
- All arguments are assumed to be optional and do not include descriptions as variables do not have specification in Langfuse
- List operations require fetching each prompt individually in the background to extract the arguments, this works but is not efficient

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or a PR ([repo](https://github.com/langfuse/mcp-server-langfuse)) if you have any suggestions or feedback.

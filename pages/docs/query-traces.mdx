# Query Traces

Langfuse is [open-source](/docs/open-source) and data tracked with Langfuse is open. You can query/export data via: [SDKs](#sdks), [API](#api), and [Langfuse UI](#ui).

Common use cases:

- Train or [fine-tune](/docs/fine-tuning) models on the production traces in Langfuse. E.g. to create a small model after having used a large model in production for a specific use case.
- Collect few-shot examples to improve quality of output.
- Programmatically create [datasets](/docs/datasets).

Want to learn more about the Langfuse data model? Check out our [introduction to tracing in Langfuse](/docs/tracing).

## SDKs [#sdks]

Via the [SDKs](/docs/sdk/overview) for Python and JS/TS you can easily query the API without having to write the HTTP requests yourself.

# Query Traces

Langfuse is [open-source](/docs/open-source) and data tracked with Langfuse is open. You can query/export data via: [SDKs](#sdks), [API](#api), and [Langfuse UI](#ui).

Common use cases:

- Train or [fine-tune](/docs/fine-tuning) models on the production traces in Langfuse. E.g. to create a small model after having used a large model in production for a specific use case.
- Collect few-shot examples to improve quality of output.
- Programmatically create [datasets](/docs/datasets).

If you are new to Langfuse, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the [Langfuse data model](/docs/tracing-data-model).

<Callout type="info">

New data is typically available for querying within 15-30 seconds of ingestion, though processing times may vary at times. Please visit [status.langfuse.com](https://status.langfuse.com) if you encounter any issues.

## SDKs [#sdks]

Via the [SDKs](/docs/sdk/overview) for Python and JS/TS you can easily query the API without having to write the HTTP requests yourself.

<Callout type="info">

There dedicated `fetch*` methods for core entities are covered by tests and semantic versioning. The methods on the `langfuse.api` are auto-generated from the API reference and cover all entities.

```bash
pip install langfuse
```

```python
from langfuse import Langfuse
langfuse = Langfuse(
  secret_key="sk-lf-...",
  public_key="pk-lf-...",
  host="https://cloud.langfuse.com"  # ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º EU region
  # host="https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ US region
)

### Dedicated fetch_* methods for core entities

# Fetch list of traces, supports filters and pagination
traces = langfuse.fetch_traces()

# Fetch a single trace by ID
trace = langfuse.fetch_trace("traceId")

# Fetch list of observations, supports filters and pagination
observations = langfuse.fetch_observations()

# Fetch a single observation by ID
observation = langfuse.fetch_observation("observationId")

# Fetch list of sessions
sessions = langfuse.fetch_sessions()

### Methods on langfuse.api namespace for other entities (generated from the API reference)

# Fetch a single score by ID
langfuse.api.score.get("scoreId")

# Explore more entities via Intellisense
langfuse.api.*
```

# API Reference

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Have a look at the `langfuse` [object model](/docs/core-concepts#object-model)
  for further details on the API.
</Callout>

There are two ways to access the API:

1. Server-side: [Full access with secret key](#full-access-with-secret-key)
2. Client-side: [Restricted access with public key](#restricted-access-with-public-key-client-side)

## Full access with secret key

The full API is available with a secret key. This key should not be exposed to users.

**Authentication (Basic)**: pass the `public key` as username and the `secret key` as password

## Restricted access with public key (client-side)

To allow for client-side usage of the API, a subset of the API routes are available with a public key. To integrate this API with your web application, you can also use the [Typescript frontend SDK](/docs/sdk/typescript#frontend).

**Authentication (Bearer)**: `Bearer <public key>` (authorization header)

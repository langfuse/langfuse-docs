# Roadmap

Langfuse is [open source](/docs/open-source) and we want to be fully transparent what we're working on and what's next. This roadmap is a living document and we'll update it as we make progress.

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info">

**Your feedback is highly appreciated** Feel like something is missing? Add new [ideas on GitHub](/ideas) or
vote on existing ones. Both are a great way to contribute to Langfuse and help
us understand what is important to you.

## üß™ Pre-release

- Human annotation queue: A better UX for manually scoring LLM completions in the Langfuse UI along multiple dimensions

_Please reach out if you are interested in testing these features before they are released to provide feedback and help shape the future of Langfuse: early-access@langfuse.com._

## üöß In progress

- Prompt management: comments on versions, tags via SDK and api
- Langfuse v3.0: async worker container, ingestion queues, OLAP database. Learn more in this [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1902).
- Improve Tables, Dashboards and Single Trace UI
- Move to SDK references generated from docstrings to improve the developer experience (Intellisense) and reduce the risk of errors
- Introduce Organizations to user data model to allow for better sharing of projects, fully self-serve upgrading and better permissioning
- Finish up SDK referencing in docstrings (Python done, TS to go)


## üîÆ Planned

- Datasets: make usable in CI (e.g GitHub Actions), run on Webhook
- Decorator-like experience for Langfuse TS SDK
- Improve Onboarding Experience
- internal: Add data hooks for growth loops
- users: Add Webhooks in product


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Upcoming breaking changes

- OpenAI integration, dropping support of `openai < 1.0.0` to greatly simplify the integration and improve the developer experience of everyone on `openai >= 1`. No timeline on this yet.
- Self-hosting: Langfuse v3.0 will add additional containers and database for improve scalability. Learn more in this [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1902). We will provide a migration path. Scheduled for May/June 2024.

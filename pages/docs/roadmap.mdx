# Langfuse Roadmap

Langfuse is [open source](/docs/open-source) and we want to be fully transparent what we're working on and what's next. This roadmap is a living document and we'll update it as we make progress.

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info">
  **Your feedback is highly appreciated**. Feel like something is missing? Add
  new [ideas on GitHub](/ideas) or vote on existing ones. Both are a great way
  to contribute to Langfuse and help us understand what is important to you.

## 🚧 In progress

- Tracing
  - Full-text search: Search across the inputs/outputs of traces, sessions, and datasets ([#939](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/939))
  - Analytics
    - Customizable dashboards: Create and share custom dashboards based on metrics extracted from traces ([#1011](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1011))
    - Query API for custom metric aggregations to replace the static [daily metrics API](/docs/analytics/daily-metrics-api)
  - Make Langfuse SDKs OpenTelemetry native, Langfuse Server already supports OpenTelemetry ([docs](/docs/opentelemetry/get-started))
- Evaluation
  - Session-level scores ([#2728](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/2728))
  - Improvements to core eval views (e.g. compare run view)
  - Annotate dataset experiments
- UI/UX: improvements of all core product features
- Admin/SCIM API to programmatically manage organizations, projects, and users ([#1007](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1007))
- Self-host documentation: provide better guidance on selecting the right deployment options and scaling Langfuse

## 🔮 Planned

- Agent Observability: Improve native support for agentic applications
  - Generalized agent graphs ([#2669](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/2669)), beta available for LangGraph ([docs](/docs/tracing-features/agent-graphs))
  - Filtering for tool calls used within an execution
  - Opinionated agent evaluations
- Evaluation
  - Simplified configuration of in-UI evals
  - More llm-as-a-judge templates for RAG, Agents, and conversational applications
  - Non-LLM evaluators: classifiers, custom code, regex, etc.
  - Evals on repeated spans/observations within a trace
  - Comparisons of different evaluation metrics
  - Improvements to Langfuse SDK to simplify creation of experiments
  - End-to-end examples on how to run Langfuse Experiments as regression tests in CI/CD pipelines
  - Add tracing to LLM-as-a-judge evals for better observability (debugging and cost tracking)
- UI
  - Filters: saved views, new filter UI on tables
- Prompt Management
  - Placeholders for chat messages ([#2210](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/2210))
  - Track prompt variables in production tracing, simplify adding to datasets and running prompt experiments
  - LLM-assisted prompt engineering
  - Folders ([#4874](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/4874))
  - A/B testing
  - Native support for tool calls ([#2624](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/2624))
- Tracing Enhancements
  - Realtime LLM: Bespoke traces for datastreams of realtime APIs, especially multi-modal ([#4757](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/4757))
- Data Platform
  - Webhooks to subscribe to changes within your Langfuse project ([#1033](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1033))
  - Alerts: Create alerts for custom metric thresholds, errors, etc.
  - Rule-based routing between Langfuse product features
- Prompt Experiments & Playground
  - Split view to compare different LLMs and prompts side by side before running a [prompt experiment](/docs/datasets/prompt-experiments)
  - Add tool-call and structured output support to prompt experiments
- Langfuse Cloud
  - HIPAA compliance
  - Usage based billing alerts

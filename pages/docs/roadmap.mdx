# Roadmap

Langfuse is [open source](/docs/open-source) and we want to be fully transparent what we're working on and what's next. This roadmap is a living document and we'll update it as we make progress.

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info">

**Your feedback is highly appreciated**

  us understand what is important to you.

export const ChangelogList = () => (
  <ul className="list-disc list pl-6">
    {getPagesUnderRoute("/changelog")
      .sort(
        (a, b) =>
          new Date(b.frontMatter.date).getTime() -
          new Date(a.frontMatter.date).getTime()
      )
      .slice(0, 10)
      .map((page, i) => (

## 🧪 Pre-release

- Integration to push Langfuse metrics to [PostHog](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) ([integration docs](/docs/analytics/posthog))
- Evaluation service to run custom model-based evals on historical and newly ingested traces ([docs](/docs/scores/model-based-evals))

_Please reach out if you are interested in testing these features before they are released to provide feedback and help shape the future of Langfuse: early-access@langfuse.com._

## 🚧 In progress

- Manual evaluations in Langfuse UI along multiple dimensions, currently only a single dimension is supported
- Improved datasets UI/UX
- Prompt playground connected to datasets and prompt management
- Infrastructure: queued ingestion to handle large and spiky loads on small instances
- Improved tables across the Langfuse UI to display all relevant information and be more user-friendly
- Move to SDK references generated from docstrings to improve the developer experience (Intellisense) and reduce the risk of errors

## 🔮 Planned

- Datasets: make them usable in CI (e.g GitHub Actions)
- Prompt management: multiple environments, comments on versions
- Infrastructure: add OLAP database for faster analytical queries

## ⚠️ Upcoming breaking changes

- OpenAI integration, dropping support of `openai < 1.0.0` to greatly simplify the integration and improve the developer experience of everyone on `openai >= 1`
- Self-hosting: langfuse will move from a single container to a multi-container setup (queues, async worker, OLAP database) to improve scalability and reliability. We will publish an extensive guide once the changes are in pre-release to help everyone migrate.

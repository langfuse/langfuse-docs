# Roadmap

Langfuse is [open source](/docs/open-source) and we want to be transparent about what we are working on and what is coming next. This roadmap is a living document and will be updated as we make progress and as we receive feedback from our community.

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  **Feel like something is missing?** Add new ideas [on GitHub](/ideas) or vote
  on existing ones. Both are a great way to contribute to Langfuse and help us
  understand what is important to you.

## üß™ Pre-release

- Integration to push Langfuse metrics to [PostHog](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) ([draft changelog](https://langfuse-docs-git-posthog-integration-langfuse.vercel.app/changelog/2024-03-03-posthog-integration))
- Decorator-based Python integration ([GitHub post](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1009) with installation instructions)

  ```python
  from langfuse.decorators import observe

  @observe()
  def span_inside_trace():
      print("Hello, from a span inside a trace!")


  @observe()
  def function_to_trace():
      print("Hello, from the parent trace!")
      span_inside_trace()

  function_to_trace()
  ```

_Please reach out if you are interested in testing these features before they are released to provide feedback and help shape the future of Langfuse: early-access@langfuse.com._

## üöß In progress

- Manual evaluations in Langfuse UI along multiple dimensions, currently only a single dimension is supported
- Improved datasets UI/UX
- Evaluation service to run custom model-based evals on historical and newly ingested traces
- Infrastructure: queued ingestion to handle large and spiky loads on small instances
- Improved tables across the Langfuse UI to display all relevant information and be more user-friendly
- Move to SDK references generated from docstrings to improve the developer experience (Intellisense) and reduce the risk of errors

## üîÆ Planned

- Datasets: make them usable in CI (e.g GitHub Actions)
- Langchain integration: support batch (Python) and async (Python) methods
- Prompt playground connected to datasets and prompt management
- Prompt management: multiple environments, comments on versions
- Infrastructure: add OLAP database for faster analytical queries

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Upcoming breaking changes

- OpenAI integration, dropping support of `openai < 1.0.0` to greatly simplify the integration and improve the developer experience of everyone on `openai >= 1`
- Self-hosting: langfuse will move from a single container to a multi-container setup (queues, async worker, OLAP database) to improve scalability and reliability. We will publish an extensive guide once the changes are in pre-release to help everyone migrate.

# Langfuse Roadmap

Langfuse is [open source](/docs/open-source) and we want to be fully transparent what we're working on and what's next. This roadmap is a living document and we'll update it as we make progress.

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info">
  **Your feedback is highly appreciated**. Feel like something is missing? Add
  new [ideas on GitHub](/ideas) or vote on existing ones. Both are a great way
  to contribute to Langfuse and help us understand what is important to you.

## üöß In progress

- Various improvements, including:
  - Typesafe sdk methods for all API routes
  - Evaluation runs on historical data
  - Eval execution states across Langfuse Tracing and Datasets
  - Use JSON path to extract structured data from traces for llm-as-judge evals
  - Save table filters as views
  - "Peek view" for tables, preview trace without switching the page

  - Filtering for tool calls used within an execution
  - Opinionated agent evaluations
- **Tracing Enhancements**
  - **Environments**: Native support for separating different environments within a project ([#5005](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/5005))
  - **Realtime LLM**: Bespoke traces for datastreams of realtime APIs, especially multi-modal ([#4757](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/4757))

  - Comparisons of different evaluation metrics
  - Session-level scores ([#2728](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/2728))
- **Query 100s of millions of traces**:
  - **Full-text search**: Search across the inputs/outputs of traces, sessions, and datasets ([#939](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/939))
  - **Self-serve dashboards**: Create and share custom dashboards based on metrics extracted from traces ([#1011](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1011))
- **Data Platform**
  - Webhooks to subscribe to changes within your Langfuse project ([#1033](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1033))
  - Batched exports to own storage buckets for downstream use and archival

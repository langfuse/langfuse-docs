# Langfuse Roadmap

Langfuse is [open source](/open-source) and we want to be fully transparent what we're working on and what's next. This roadmap is a living document and we'll update it as we make progress.

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info">
  **Your feedback is highly appreciated**. Feel like something is missing? Add
  new [ideas on GitHub](/ideas) or vote on existing ones. Both are a great way
  to contribute to Langfuse and help us understand what is important to you.

## Active Development

### Agent Observability

- Improve Langfuse to dig into complex, long running agents more intuitively

### Evals

- Introduce experiments as a first class citizen, remove the dependency on datasets to allow for more bespoke unit-tests
- Overhaul experiment (dataset run) comparison views to make it easier to work with experiment results
- Dataset management: bulk add traces to datasets
- Improve comments across the product to allow for more qualitative evaluation workflows and collaboration

### Playground

- Experiment with prompts/models in playground based on logged traces and datasets with reference inputs
- Langfuse model input/output data schema to increase model interoperability for structured outputs and tool calls
- Make Playground stateful and collaborative

### UI/UX

- Improve onboarding experience
- Improve core screens, especially for new and non-technical users
- Increase UI performance for extremely large traces and datasets

### Infrastructure / Data Platform

- We strongly increase ingestion throughput, response times, and error rates across APIs by simplifying the core data model.
- Move to an observation-only and immutable data model as it better aligns with complex agents and allows us to scale our platform. Thereby, we remove traces as a first class citizen.
- Improvements across our tracing UI to make it easier to find relevant spans for complex agents.
- Webhooks for observability and evaluation events, useful for routing and alerting

# Langfuse Roadmap

Langfuse is [open source](/docs/open-source) and we want to be fully transparent what we're working on and what's next. This roadmap is a living document and we'll update it as we make progress.

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info">
  **Your feedback is highly appreciated**. Feel like something is missing? Add
  new [ideas on GitHub](/ideas) or vote on existing ones. Both are a great way
  to contribute to Langfuse and help us understand what is important to you.

## 🚧 In progress

- Various improvements, including:
  - Use "log levels" to simplify large agent traces, filter by them in UI
  - Typesafe sdk methods for all API routes
  - Commit messages on prompts
  - Duplicate prompts to edit name
  - User screen that's more helpful to summarize metrics
  - Evaluation runs on historical data
  - Eval execution states across Langfuse Tracing and Datasets
  - Use JSON path to extract structured data from traces for llm-as-judge evals
  - Save table filters as views
  - "Peek view" for tables, preview trace without switching the page
  - New observation table
  - ...

## 🔮 Planned

- **Agent Observability**: Improve native support for agentic applications
  - Visualizations of agent executions, e.g. Graph ([#2669](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/2669))
  - Filtering for tool calls used within an execution
  - Opinionated agent evaluations
- **Tracing Enhancements**
  - **Environments**: Native support for separating different environments within a project ([#5005](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/5005))
  - **Realtime LLM**: Bespoke traces for datastreams of realtime APIs, especially multi-modal ([#4757](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/4757))
  - **Open Telemetry**: Add support for OpenTelemetry-based instrumentations by adding an OpenTelemetry exporter/collector ([#2509](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/2509))
- **Prompt Management**
  - Custom RBAC for prompt change management ([#4480](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/4480))
  - LLM-assisted prompt engineering
  - Prompt composability to increase reuse of common prompts ([#1660](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1660))
  - Folders ([#4874](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/4874))
  - Native support for tool calls ([#2624](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/2624))
  - Placeholders for chat messages ([#2210](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/2210))
- **Evaluation**
  - Non-LLM evaluators: classifiers, custom code, regex, etc.
  - Evals on repeated spans/observations within a trace
  - Comparisons of different evaluation metrics
  - Session-level scores ([#2728](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/2728))
- **Query 100s of millions of traces**:
  - **Full-text search**: Search across the inputs/outputs of traces, sessions, and datasets ([#939](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/939))
  - **Self-serve dashboards**: Create and share custom dashboards based on metrics extracted from traces ([#1011](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1011))
- **Data Platform**
  - Webhooks to subscribe to changes within your Langfuse project ([#1033](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1033))
  - Batched exports to own storage buckets for downstream use and archival
  - Rule-based routing between Langfuse product features
- Other
  - **UI/UX**: improvements of all core product features
  - **Onboarding**: simplify getting started with Langfuse when not reading the docs
  - **Data retention**: Project-level data retention policies ([#2268](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/2268))

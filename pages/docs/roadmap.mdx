# Roadmap

Langfuse is [open source](/docs/open-source) and we want to be fully transparent what we're working on and what's next. This roadmap is a living document and we'll update it as we make progress.

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info">
  **Your feedback is highly appreciated**. Feel like something is missing? Add
  new [ideas on GitHub](/ideas) or vote on existing ones. Both are a great way
  to contribute to Langfuse and help us understand what is important to you.

import { getPagesUnderRoute } from "nextra/context";

    {getPagesUnderRoute("/changelog")
      .sort(
        (a, b) =>
          new Date(b.frontMatter.date).getTime() -
          new Date(a.frontMatter.date).getTime()
      )
      .slice(0, 10)
      .map((page, i) => (

## 🚧 In progress

- Langfuse v3.0: preparing Langfuse for the next level of scale using an OLAP database, a queue and another container. Parts of it are already available in Langfuse Cloud and once migration is complete, self-hosting will be upgraded as well. Learn more in this [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1902).
- Export traces and sessions from Langfuse dashboard (CSV, JSON)
- Improved tables across the Langfuse UI to display all relevant information and be more user-friendly.
- Move to SDK references generated from docstrings to improve the developer experience (Intellisense) and reduce the risk of errors.
- Annotation queue to assign annotations to team members.
- Improve cost tracking of multi-modal LLMs and more complex pricing models (e.g. Anthropic/Google Context Caching, Google Vertex pricing)

## 🔮 Planned

- Webhooks to subscribe to changes within your Langfuse project.
- Datasets: make them usable in CI (e.g GitHub Actions).
- Comments on prompt versions.
- Improved datasets UI/UX.
- Add non-LLM evaluators to online evaluation within Langfuse UI.
- Revamped context-aware JS integration to to remove the need for nesting of tracing calls, similar to Python decorator.
- Better support for multi-modal traces that use base64 encoded images.

## ⚠️ Upcoming breaking changes

- Self-hosting: Langfuse v3.0 will add additional containers and database for improve scalability. Learn more in this [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1902). We will provide a migration path. Scheduled for August/September 2024.
- OpenAI integration, dropping support of `openai < 1.0.0` to greatly simplify the integration and improve the developer experience of everyone on `openai >= 1`. No timeline on this yet as many libraries still depend on the old version.

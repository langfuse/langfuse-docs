# Evaluation Data Model

Evaluation is critical for the LLM Application Development workflow. Also, it is very specific to a certain use case and application. Thus, the evaluation data model in Langfuse is flexible to represent any evaluation metric. It is used across the evalaution methods outlined in the [overview](/docs/scores/overview).

`Scores` serve as objects for storing evaluation metrics in Langfuse.

- They are always associated with a trace
- Optionally they can reference a specific observation within a trace ([tracing data model](/docs/tracing/overview)).
- They can be _numeric_, _categorical_, or _boolean_.
- A `comment` can be added to provide additional context or information about the score.

Optionally, scores can be linked to a `score configuration` to ensure they comply with a specific schema. More on this below.

<summary>How are scores used across Langfuse?</summary>

Scores can be used in multiple ways across Langfuse:

1. Displayed on trace to provide a quick overview
2. Segment all execution traces by scores to e.g. find all traces with a low quality score
3. Analytics: Detailed score reporting with drill downs into use cases and user segments

<summary>Frequently used scores</summary>

Scores in Langfuse are adaptable (it is just a `name`) and designed to cater to the unique requirements of specific LLM applications. They typically serve to measure the following aspects:

- Quality
  - Factual accuracy
  - Completeness of the information provided
  - Verification against hallucinations
- Style
  - Sentiment portrayed
  - Tonality of the content
  - Potential toxicity
- Security
  - Similarity to prevalent prompt injections
  - Instances of model refusals (e.g., as a language model, ...)

## `Score` object in Langfuse

| `name`          | string | Name of the score, e.g. user_feedback, hallucination_eval                                                                                                                                                 |
| `value`         | number | Optional: Numeric value of the score. Always defined for numeric and boolean scores. Optional for categorical scores.                                                                                     |
| `stringValue`   | string | Optional: String equivalent of the score's numeric value for boolean and categorical data types. Automatically set for categorical scores based on the config if the `configId` is provided.              |
| `traceId`       | string | Id of the trace the score relates to                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `observationId` | string | Optional: Observation (e.g. LLM call) the score relates to                                                                                                                                                |
| `comment`       | string | Optional: Evaluation comment, commonly used for user feedback, eval output or internal notes                                                                                                              |
| `id`            | string | Unique identifier of the score. Auto-generated by SDKs. Optionally can also be used as an indempotency key to update scores.                                                                              |

| `dataType`      | string | Automatically set based on the config data type when the `configId` is provided. Otherwise can be defined manually as `NUMERIC`, `CATEGORICAL` or `BOOLEAN`                                               |
| `configId`      | string | Optional: Score config id to ensure that the score follows a specific schema. Can be defined in the Langfuse UI or via API. When provided the score's `dataType` is automatically set based on the config |

## Define schema via `score config`

If you'd like to ensure that your scores follow a specific schema, you can define a `score config` in the Langfuse UI or via our API.

A score config includes:

- Score name
- Data type: `NUMERIC`, `CATEGORICAL`, `BOOLEAN`
- Constraints on score value range:
  - Min/max values for numerical data types
  - Custom categories for categorical data types

Configs are immutable but can be archived (and restored anytime). Using score configs allows you to standardize your scoring schema across your team and ensure that scores are consistent and comparable for future analysis.

# User Feedback

User feedback is a great source to evaluate the quality of an LLM app's output. In Langfuse, feedback is collected as a [`score`](/docs/scores) and attached to an execution trace or an individual LLM generation.

## Types of Feedback

Depending on the type of the application, there are different types of feedback that can be collected that vary in quality, detail, and quantity.

- **Explicit Feedback**: Directly prompt the user to give feedback, this can be a rating, a like, a dislike, a scale or a comment. While it is simple to implement, quality and quantity of the feedback is often low.
- **Implicit Feedback**: Measure the user's behavior, e.g., time spent on a page, click-through rate, accepting/rejecting a model-generated output. This type of feedback is more difficult to implement but is often more frequent and reliable.

## Collect User Feedback in Langfuse

The easiest way to collect user feedback is via the **Langfuse Web SDK**. Thereby you can ingest scores directly from the browser. See the [Web SDK documentation](/docs/integrations/sdk/typescript-web) for more details.

**Integration**

```typescript {1, 9, 17-18} filename="UserFeedbackComponent.tsx"
import { LangfuseWeb } from "langfuse";

export function UserFeedbackComponent(props: { traceId: string }) {
  const langfuseWeb = new LangfuseWeb({
    publicKey: env.NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY,
  });

  const handleUserFeedback = async (value: number) =>
    await langfuseWeb.score({
      traceId: props.traceId,
      name: "user_feedback",
      value,
    });

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => handleUserFeedback(1)}>👍</button>
      <button onClick={() => handleUserFeedback(0)}>👎</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</div>
<div className="flex-1">

Alternatively, you can ingest feedback as scores server-side via the SDKs for [Python](/docs/integrations/sdk/python) and [JS/TS](/docs/integrations/sdk/typescript), or via the [HTTP API](/docs/integrations/api).

## Live demo

We implemented collection of user feedback into the Q&A chatbot for the Langfuse docs.

In this example you see the following steps:

1. Collection of feedback using the Langfuse Web SDK
   > _Negative, Langchain not included in response_
2. Browsing of feedback
3. Identification of the root cause of the low-quality response
   > Docs on Langchain integration are not included in embedding similarity search

→ [Try the demo yourself](/docs/demo) and browse the collected feedback in Langfuse

# SDKs

The Langfuse SDKs are the recommended way to integrate with Langfuse.

_Exception: if you use Langchain, use the [integration](/docs/langchain) for automated tracing of your Langchain chains/agents._

## Benefits of the SDKs

- Fully async requests, using Langfuse adds almost no latency
- Accurate latency tracking using synchronous timestamps
- IDs available for downstream use
- Great DX when nesting observations
- Cannot break your application, all errors are caught and logged

### Typescript

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/langfuse?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/langfuse)

```sh npm2yarn
npm install langfuse
```

- Fully typed
- Edge-ready, e.g., Vercel, Cloudflare, Deno
- Works client-side to report user feedback (with only the public_key)

→ For more information, see [Typescript (Node.js, Edge)](/docs/sdk/typescript) and [Typescript (Web)](/docs/sdk/typescript-web) docs.

### Python

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/langfuse?style=flat-square)](https://pypi.org/project/langfuse/)

```sh
pip install langfuse
```

- Uses Pydantic for typing and validation
- Langchain callback handler

→ For more information, see [Python docs](/docs/sdk/python).

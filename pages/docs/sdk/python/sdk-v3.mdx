# Python SDK (v3)

<Callout type="info">

If you are self-hosting Langfuse, the Python SDK v3 requires [**Langfuse platform version >= 3.63.0**](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/releases/tag/v3.63.0) for traces to be correctly processed.

</Callout>

Our [OpenTelemetry-based](https://opentelemetry.io/) Python SDK (v3) is the latest generation of the SDK designed for a improved developer experience and enhanced ease of use. Built on the robust OpenTelemetry Python SDK, it offers a more intuitive API for comprehensive tracing of your LLM application.

The v3 SDK introduces several key benefits:

- **Improved Developer Experience**: A more intuitive API means less code to write for tracing your application, simplifying the integration process.
- **Unified Context Sharing**: Seamlessly hook into the tracing context of the current span to update it or create child spans. This is particularly beneficial for integrating with other instrumented libraries.
- **Broad Third-Party Integrations**: Any library instrumented with OpenTelemetry will work out-of-the-box with the Langfuse SDK. Spans from these libraries are automatically captured and correctly nested within your Langfuse traces.

There are three main ways of instrumenting your application with the new Langfuse SDK. All of them are fully interoperable with each other.

## Setup

### Installation

To install the v3 SDK, run:

```bash
pip install langfuse
```

### Initialize Client

Begin by initializing the `Langfuse` client. You must provide your Langfuse public and secret keys. These can be passed as constructor arguments or set as environment variables (recommended).

If you are self-hosting Langfuse or using a data region other than the default (EU, `https://cloud.langfuse.com`), ensure you configure the `host` argument or the `LANGFUSE_HOST` environment variable (recommended).

<Tabs items={["via Environment Variables (recommended)", "via Constructor Arguments"]}>
<Tab>
```bash filename=".env"
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="pk-lf-..."
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="sk-lf-..."
LANGFUSE_HOST="https://cloud.langfuse.com" # US region: https://us.cloud.langfuse.com
```

</Tab>

<Tab>

```python filename="Initialize client"
from langfuse import Langfuse

# Initialize with constructor arguments

langfuse = Langfuse(
    public_key="YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY",
    secret_key="YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
    host="https://cloud.langfuse.com" # US region: https://us.cloud.langfuse.com
)
```

<Callout type="info">

If you are reinstantiating Langfuse client with different constructor arguments but the same `public_key`, the client will reuse the same instance and ignore the new arguments.

Verify connection with `langfuse.auth_check()`
</summary>

You can also verify your connection to the Langfuse server using `langfuse.auth_check()`. We do not recommend using this in production as this adds latency to your application.

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()

# Verify connection, do not use in production as this is a synchronous call
if langfuse.auth_check():
    print("Langfuse client is authenticated and ready!")
else:
    print("Authentication failed. Please check your credentials and host.")
```

### Accessing the Client Globally

The Langfuse client is a singleton. It can be accessed anywhere in your application using the `get_client` function.

Optionally, you can initialize the client via `Langfuse()` in order to pass in configuration options (see above). Otherwise, it is created automatically when you call `get_client()` based on environment variables.

```python
from langfuse import get_client

# Optionally, initialize the client with configuration options
# langfuse = Langfuse(public_key="pk-lf-...", secret_key="sk-lf-...")

# Get the default client
client = get_client()
```

## Basic Tracing

Langfuse provides flexible ways to create and manage traces and their constituent observations (spans and generations).

### `@observe` Decorator

The `@observe()` decorator provides a convenient way to automatically trace function executions, including capturing their inputs, outputs, execution time, and any errors. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous functions.

```python
from langfuse import observe

@observe()
def my_data_processing_function(data, parameter):
    # ... processing logic ...
    return {"processed_data": data, "status": "ok"}

@observe(name="llm-call", as_type="generation")
async def my_async_llm_call(prompt_text):
    # ... async LLM call ...
    return "LLM response"
```

**Parameters:**

- `name: Optional[str]`: Custom name for the created span/generation. Defaults to the function name.
- `as_type: Optional[Literal["generation"]]`: If set to `"generation"`, a Langfuse generation object is created, suitable for LLM calls. Otherwise, a regular span is created.
- `capture_input: bool`: Whether to capture function arguments as input. Defaults to env var `LANGFUSE_OBSERVE_DECORATOR_IO_CAPTURE_ENABLED` or `True` if not set.
- `capture_output: bool`: Whether to capture function return value as output. Defaults to env var `LANGFUSE_OBSERVE_DECORATOR_IO_CAPTURE_ENABLED` or `True` if not set.
- `transform_to_string: Optional[Callable[[Iterable], str]]`: For functions that return generators (sync or async), this callable can be provided to transform the collected chunks into a single string for the `output` field. If not provided, and all chunks are strings, they will be concatenated. Otherwise, the list of chunks is stored.

**Trace Context and Special Keyword Arguments:**

The `@observe` decorator automatically propagates the OTEL trace context. If a decorated function is called from within an active Langfuse span (or another OTEL span), the new observation will be nested correctly.

You can also pass special keyword arguments to a decorated function to control its tracing behavior:

- `langfuse_trace_id: str`: Explicitly set the trace ID for this function call. Must be a valid W3C Trace Context trace ID (32-char hex). If you have a trace ID from an external system, you can use `Langfuse.create_trace_id(seed=external_trace_id)` to generate a valid deterministic ID.
- `langfuse_parent_observation_id: str`: Explicitly set the parent observation ID. Must be a valid W3C Trace Context span ID (16-char hex).

```python
@observe()
def my_function(a, b):
    return a + b

# Call with a specific trace context
my_function(1, 2, langfuse_trace_id="1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef")
```

<Callout type='info'>

The observe decorator is capturing the args, kwargs and return value of decorated functions by default. This may lead to performance issues in your application if you have large or deeply nested objects there. To avoid this, explicitly disable function IO capture on the decorated function by passing `capture_input / capture_output` with value `False` or globally by setting the environment variable `LANGFUSE_OBSERVE_DECORATOR_IO_CAPTURE_ENABLED=False`.

</Callout>

### Context Managers

You can create spans or generations anywhere in your application. If you need more control than the `@observe` decorator, the primary way to do this is using context managers (with `with` statements), which ensure that observations are properly started and ended.

- `langfuse.start_as_current_span()`: Creates a new span and sets it as the currently active observation in the OTEL context for its duration. Any new observations created within this block will be its children.
- `langfuse.start_as_current_generation()`: Similar to the above, but creates a specialized "generation" observation for LLM calls.

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()

with langfuse.start_as_current_span(
    name="user-request-pipeline",
    input={"user_query": "Tell me a joke about OpenTelemetry"},
) as root_span:
    # This span is now active in the context.

    # Add trace attributes
    root_span.update_trace(
        user_id="user_123",
        session_id="session_abc",
        tags=["experimental", "comedy"]
    )

    # Create a nested generation
    with langfuse.start_as_current_generation(
        name="joke-generation",
        model="gpt-4o",
        input=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke about OpenTelemetry"}],
        model_parameters={"temperature": 0.7}
    ) as generation:
        # Simulate an LLM call
        joke_response = "Why did the OpenTelemetry collector break up with the span? Because it needed more space... for its attributes!"
        token_usage = {"input_tokens": 10, "output_tokens": 25}

        generation.update(
            output=joke_response,
            usage_details=token_usage
        )
        # Generation ends automatically here

    root_span.update(output={"final_joke": joke_response})
    # Root span ends automatically here
```

### Manual Observations

For scenarios where you need to create an observation (a span or generation) without altering the currently active OpenTelemetry context, you can use `langfuse.start_span()` or `langfuse.start_generation()`.

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()

span = langfuse.start_span(name="my-span")

span.end() # Important: Manually end the span
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Manual Ending Required">
  If you use `langfuse.start_span()` or `langfuse.start_generation()`, you are
  responsible for calling `.end()` on the returned observation object. Failure
  to do so will result in incomplete or missing observations in Langfuse. Their
  `start_as_current_...` counterparts used with a `with` statement handle this
  automatically.
</Callout>

**Key Characteristics:**

- **No Context Shift**: Unlike their `start_as_current_...` counterparts, these methods **do not** set the new observation as the active one in the OpenTelemetry context. The previously active span (if any) remains the current context for subsequent operations in the main execution flow.
- **Parenting**: The observation created by `start_span()` or `start_generation()` will still be a child of the span that was active in the context at the moment of its creation.
- **Manual Lifecycle**: These observations are not managed by a `with` block and therefore **must be explicitly ended** by calling their `.end()` method.
- **Nesting Children**:
  - Subsequent observations created using the global `langfuse.start_as_current_span()` (or similar global methods) will _not_ be children of these "manual" observations. Instead, they will be parented by the original active span.
  - To create children directly under a "manual" observation, you would use methods _on that specific observation object_ (e.g., `manual_span.start_as_current_span(...)`).

**When to Use:**

This approach is useful when you need to:

- Record work that is self-contained or happens in parallel to the main execution flow but should still be part of the same overall trace (e.g., a background task initiated by a request).
- Manage the observation's lifecycle explicitly, perhaps because its start and end are determined by non-contiguous events.
- Obtain an observation object reference before it's tied to a specific context block.

**Example with more complex nesting:**

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()

# This outer span establishes an active context.
with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="main-operation") as main_operation_span:
    # 'main_operation_span' is the current active context.

    # 1. Create a "manual" span using langfuse.start_span().
    #    - It becomes a child of 'main_operation_span'.
    #    - Crucially, 'main_operation_span' REMAINS the active context.
    #    - 'manual_side_task' does NOT become the active context.
    manual_side_task = langfuse.start_span(name="manual-side-task")
    manual_side_task.update(input="Data for side task")

    # 2. Start another operation that DOES become the active context.
    #    This will be a child of 'main_operation_span', NOT 'manual_side_task',
    #    because 'manual_side_task' did not alter the active context.
    with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="core-step-within-main") as core_step_span:
        # 'core_step_span' is now the active context.
        # 'manual_side_task' is still open but not active in the global context.
        core_step_span.update(input="Data for core step")
        # ... perform core step logic ...
        core_step_span.update(output="Core step finished")
    # 'core_step_span' ends. 'main_operation_span' is the active context again.

    # 3. Complete and end the manual side task.
    # This could happen at any point after its creation, even after 'core_step_span'.
    manual_side_task.update(output="Side task completed")
    manual_side_task.end() # Manual end is crucial for 'manual_side_task'

    main_operation_span.update(output="Main operation finished")
# 'main_operation_span' ends automatically here.

# Expected trace structure in Langfuse:
# - main-operation
#   |- manual-side-task
#   |- core-step-within-main
#     (Note: 'core-step-within-main' is a sibling to 'manual-side-task', both children of 'main-operation')
```

### Nesting Observations

<Tabs items={["Observe Decorator", "Context Managers", "Manual"]}>
<Tab>
The function call hierarchy is automatically captured by the `@observe` decorator reflected in the trace.

```python
from langfuse import observe

@observe
def my_data_processing_function(data, parameter):
    # ... processing logic ...
    return {"processed_data": data, "status": "ok"}


@observe
def main_function(data, parameter):
    return my_data_processing_function(data, parameter)
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Context Managers">
Nesting is handled automatically by OpenTelemetry's context propagation. When you create a new observation (span or generation) using `start_as_current_span` or `start_as_current_generation`, it becomes a child of the observation that was active in the context when it was created.

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()

with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="outer-process") as outer_span:
    # outer_span is active

    with langfuse.start_as_current_generation(name="llm-step-1") as gen1:
        # gen1 is active, child of outer_span
        gen1.update(output="LLM 1 output")

    with outer_span.start_as_current_span(name="intermediate-step") as mid_span:
        # mid_span is active, also a child of outer_span
        # This demonstrates using the yielded span object to create children

        with mid_span.start_as_current_generation(name="llm-step-2") as gen2:
            # gen2 is active, child of mid_span
            gen2.update(output="LLM 2 output")

        mid_span.update(output="Intermediate processing done")

    outer_span.update(output="Outer process finished")
```

</Tab>

<Tab>
If you are creating observations manually (not `_as_current_`), you can use the methods on the parent `LangfuseSpan` or `LangfuseGeneration` object to create children. These children will _not_ become the current context unless their `_as_current_` variants are used.

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()

parent = langfuse.start_span(name="manual-parent")

child_span = parent.start_span(name="manual-child-span")
# ... work ...
child_span.end()

child_gen = parent.start_generation(name="manual-child-generation")
# ... work ...
child_gen.end()

parent.end()
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Updating Observations

You can update observations with new information as your code executes.

- For spans/generations created via context managers or assigned to variables: use the `.update()` method on the object.
- To update the _currently active_ observation in the context (without needing a direct reference to it): use `langfuse.update_current_span()` or `langfuse.update_current_generation()`.

**`LangfuseSpan.update()` / `LangfuseGeneration.update()` parameters:**

| `cost_details`          | `Optional[Dict[str, float]]`    | Cost information (e.g., `{"total_cost": 0.0023}`).                    | Generation |
| `prompt`                | `Optional[PromptClient]`        | Associated `PromptClient` object from Langfuse prompt management.     | Generation |

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()

with langfuse.start_as_current_generation(name="llm-call", model="gpt-3.5-turbo") as gen:
    gen.update(input={"prompt": "Why is the sky blue?"})
    # ... make LLM call ...
    response_text = "Rayleigh scattering..."
    gen.update(
        output=response_text,
        usage_details={"input_tokens": 5, "output_tokens": 50},
        metadata={"confidence": 0.9}
    )

# Alternatively, update the current observation in context:
with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="data-processing"):
    # ... some processing ...
    langfuse.update_current_span(metadata={"step1_complete": True})
    # ... more processing ...
    langfuse.update_current_span(output={"result": "final_data"})
```

### Setting Trace Attributes

Trace-level attributes apply to the entire trace, not just a single observation. You can set or update these using:

- The `.update_trace()` method on any `LangfuseSpan` or `LangfuseGeneration` object within that trace.
- `langfuse.update_current_trace()` to update the trace associated with the currently active observation.

**Trace attribute parameters:**

| Parameter    | Type                  | Description                                                      |
| :----------- | :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`       | `Optional[str]`       | Name for the trace.                                              |
| `user_id`    | `Optional[str]`       | ID of the user associated with this trace.                       |
| `session_id` | `Optional[str]`       | Session identifier for grouping related traces.                  |
| `version`    | `Optional[str]`       | Version of your application/service for this trace.              |
| `input`      | `Optional[Any]`       | Overall input for the entire trace.                              |
| `output`     | `Optional[Any]`       | Overall output for the entire trace.                             |
| `metadata`   | `Optional[Any]`       | Additional metadata for the trace.                               |
| `tags`       | `Optional[List[str]]` | List of tags to categorize the trace.                            |
| `public`     | `Optional[bool]`      | Whether the trace should be publicly accessible (if configured). |

**Example: Setting Multiple Trace Attributes**

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()

with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="initial-operation") as span:
    # Set trace attributes early
    span.update_trace(
        user_id="user_xyz",
        session_id="session_789",
        tags=["beta-feature", "llm-chain"]
    )
    # ...
    # Later, from another span in the same trace:
    with span.start_as_current_generation(name="final-generation") as gen:
        # ...
        langfuse.update_current_trace(output={"final_status": "success"}, public=True)
```

### Trace Input/Output Behavior

In v3, trace input and output are automatically set from the **root observation** (first span/generation) by default. This differs from v2 where integrations could set trace-level inputs/outputs directly.

#### Default Behavior

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()

with langfuse.start_as_current_span(
    name="user-request",
    input={"query": "What is the capital of France?"}  # This becomes the trace input
) as root_span:

    with langfuse.start_as_current_generation(
        name="llm-call",
        model="gpt-4o",
        input={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}]}
    ) as gen:
        response = "Paris is the capital of France."
        gen.update(output=response)
        # LLM generation input/output are separate from trace input/output

    root_span.update(output={"answer": "Paris"})  # This becomes the trace output
```

#### Override Default Behavior

If you need different trace inputs/outputs than the root observation, explicitly set them:

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()

with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="complex-pipeline") as root_span:
    # Root span has its own input/output
    root_span.update(input="Step 1 data", output="Step 1 result")

    # But trace should have different input/output (e.g., for LLM-as-a-judge)
    root_span.update_trace(
        input={"original_query": "User's actual question"},
        output={"final_answer": "Complete response", "confidence": 0.95}
    )

    # Now trace input/output are independent of root span input/output
```

#### Critical for LLM-as-a-Judge Features

LLM-as-a-judge and evaluation features typically rely on trace-level inputs and outputs. Make sure to set these appropriately:

```python
from langfuse import observe, get_client

langfuse = get_client()

@observe()
def process_user_query(user_question: str):
    # LLM processing...
    answer = call_llm(user_question)

    # Explicitly set trace input/output for evaluation features
    langfuse.update_current_trace(
        input={"question": user_question},
        output={"answer": answer}
    )

    return answer
```

### Trace and Observation IDs

Langfuse uses W3C Trace Context compliant IDs:

- **Trace IDs**: 32-character lowercase hexadecimal string (16 bytes).
- **Observation IDs (Span IDs)**: 16-character lowercase hexadecimal string (8 bytes).

You can retrieve these IDs:

- `langfuse.get_current_trace_id()`: Gets the trace ID of the currently active observation.
- `langfuse.get_current_observation_id()`: Gets the ID of the currently active observation.
- `span_obj.trace_id` and `span_obj.id`: Access IDs directly from a `LangfuseSpan` or `LangfuseGeneration` object.

For scenarios where you need to generate IDs outside of an active trace (e.g., to link scores to traces/observations that will be created later, or to correlate with external systems), use:

- `Langfuse.create_trace_id(seed: Optional[str] = None)`(static method): Generates a new trace ID. If a `seed` is provided, the ID is deterministic. Use the same seed to get the same ID. This is useful for correlating external IDs with Langfuse traces.

```python
from langfuse import get_client, Langfuse

langfuse = get_client()

# Get current IDs
with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="my-op") as current_op:
    trace_id = langfuse.get_current_trace_id()
    observation_id = langfuse.get_current_observation_id()
    print(f"Current Trace ID: {trace_id}, Current Observation ID: {observation_id}")
    print(f"From object: Trace ID: {current_op.trace_id}, Observation ID: {current_op.id}")

# Generate IDs deterministically
external_request_id = "req_12345"
deterministic_trace_id = Langfuse.create_trace_id(seed=external_request_id)
print(f"Deterministic Trace ID for {external_request_id}: {deterministic_trace_id}")
```

**Linking to Existing Traces (Trace Context)**

If you have a `trace_id` (and optionally a `parent_span_id`) from an external source (e.g., another service, a batch job), you can link new observations to it using the `trace_context` parameter. Note that OpenTelemetry offers native cross-service context propagation, so this is not necessarily required for calls between services that are instrumented with OTEL.

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()

existing_trace_id = "abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890" # From an upstream service
existing_parent_span_id = "fedcba0987654321" # Optional parent span in that trace

with langfuse.start_as_current_span(
    name="process-downstream-task",
    trace_context={
        "trace_id": existing_trace_id,
        "parent_span_id": existing_parent_span_id # If None, this becomes a root span in the existing trace
    }
) as span:
    # This span is now part of the trace `existing_trace_id`
    # and a child of `existing_parent_span_id` if provided.
    print(f"This span's trace_id: {span.trace_id}") # Will be existing_trace_id
    pass
```

## Client Management

### `flush()`

Manually triggers the sending of all buffered observations (spans, generations, scores, media metadata) to the Langfuse API. This is useful in short-lived scripts or before exiting an application to ensure all data is persisted.

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()
# ... create traces and observations ...
langfuse.flush() # Ensures all pending data is sent
```

The `flush()` method blocks until the queued data is processed by the respective background threads.

### `shutdown()`

Gracefully shuts down the Langfuse client. This includes:

1.  Flushing all buffered data (similar to `flush()`).
2.  Waiting for background threads (for data ingestion and media uploads) to finish their current tasks and terminate.

It's crucial to call `shutdown()` before your application exits to prevent data loss and ensure clean resource release. The SDK automatically registers an `atexit` hook to call `shutdown()` on normal program termination, but manual invocation is recommended in scenarios like:

- Long-running daemons or services when they receive a shutdown signal.
- Applications where `atexit` might not reliably trigger (e.g., certain serverless environments or forceful terminations).

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()
# ... application logic ...

# Before exiting:
langfuse.shutdown()
```

## Integrations

### OpenAI Integration

Langfuse offers a drop-in replacement for the OpenAI Python SDK to automatically trace all your OpenAI API calls. Simply change your import statement:

```diff
- import openai
+ from langfuse.openai import openai

# Your existing OpenAI code continues to work as is
# For example:
# client = openai.OpenAI()
# completion = client.chat.completions.create(...)
```

**What's automatically captured:**

- **Requests & Responses**: All prompts/completions, including support for streaming, async operations, and function/tool calls.
- **Timings**: Latencies for API calls.
- **Errors**: API errors are captured with their details.
- **Model Usage**: Token counts (input, output, total).
- **Cost**: Estimated cost in USD (based on model and token usage).
- **Media**: Input audio and output audio from speech-to-text and text-to-speech endpoints.

The integration is fully interoperable with `@observe` and manual tracing methods (`start_as_current_span`, etc.). If an OpenAI call is made within an active Langfuse span, the OpenAI generation will be correctly nested under it.

**Passing Langfuse arguments to OpenAI calls:**

You can pass Langfuse-specific arguments directly to OpenAI client methods. These will be used to enrich the trace data.

```python
from langfuse import get_client
from langfuse.openai import openai

langfuse = get_client()

client = openai.OpenAI()

with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="qna-bot-openai") as span:
    langfuse.update_current_trace(tags=["qna-bot-openai"])

    # This will be traced as a Langfuse generation
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        name="qna-bot-openai",  # Custom name for this generation in Langfuse
        metadata={"user_tier": "premium", "request_source": "web_api"}, # will be added to the Langfuse generation
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is OpenTelemetry?"}],
    )
```

**Setting trace attributes via metadata:**

You can set trace attributes (`session_id`, `user_id`, `tags`) directly on OpenAI calls using special fields in the `metadata` parameter:

```python
from langfuse.openai import openai

client = openai.OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    metadata={
        "langfuse_session_id": "session_123",
        "langfuse_user_id": "user_456",
        "langfuse_tags": ["production", "chat-bot"],
        "custom_field": "additional metadata"  # Regular metadata fields work too
    }
)
```

The special metadata fields are:
- `langfuse_session_id`: Sets the session ID for the trace
- `langfuse_user_id`: Sets the user ID for the trace
- `langfuse_tags`: Sets tags for the trace (should be a list of strings)

Supported Langfuse arguments: `name`, `metadata`, `langfuse_prompt`

### Langchain Integration

Langfuse provides a callback handler for Langchain to trace its operations.

**Setup:**

Initialize the `CallbackHandler` and add it to your Langchain calls, either globally or per-call.

```python
from langfuse import get_client
from langfuse.langchain import CallbackHandler
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI # Example LLM
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

langfuse = get_client()

# Initialize the Langfuse handler
langfuse_handler = CallbackHandler()

# Example: Using it with an LLM call
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4o")
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("Tell me a joke about {topic}")
chain = prompt | llm

with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="joke-chain") as span:
    langfuse.update_current_trace(tags=["joke-chain"])

    response = chain.invoke({"topic": "cats"}, config={"callbacks": [langfuse_handler]})
    print(response)
```

**Setting trace attributes via metadata:**

You can set trace attributes (`session_id`, `user_id`, `tags`) directly during chain invocation using special fields in the `metadata` configuration:

```python
from langfuse.langchain import CallbackHandler
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

# Initialize the Langfuse handler
langfuse_handler = CallbackHandler()

# Create your LangChain components
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4o")
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("Tell me a joke about {topic}")
chain = prompt | llm

# Set trace attributes via metadata in chain invocation
response = chain.invoke(
    {"topic": "cats"},
    config={
        "callbacks": [langfuse_handler],
        "metadata": {
            "langfuse_session_id": "session_123",
            "langfuse_user_id": "user_456",
            "langfuse_tags": ["production", "humor-bot"],
            "custom_field": "additional metadata"  # Regular metadata fields work too
        }
    }
)
```

The special metadata fields are:
- `langfuse_session_id`: Sets the session ID for the trace
- `langfuse_user_id`: Sets the user ID for the trace
- `langfuse_tags`: Sets tags for the trace (should be a list of strings)

**What's captured:**

The callback handler maps various Langchain events to Langfuse observations:

- **Chains (`on_chain_start`, `on_chain_end`, `on_chain_error`):** Traced as spans.
- **LLMs (`on_llm_start`, `on_llm_end`, `on_llm_error`, `on_chat_model_start`):** Traced as generations, capturing model name, prompts, responses, and usage if available from the LLM provider.
- **Tools (`on_tool_start`, `on_tool_end`, `on_tool_error`):** Traced as spans, capturing tool input and output.
- **Retrievers (`on_retriever_start`, `on_retriever_end`, `on_retriever_error`):** Traced as spans, capturing the query and retrieved documents.
- **Agents (`on_agent_action`, `on_agent_finish`):** Agent actions and final finishes are captured within their parent chain/agent span.

Langfuse attempts to parse model names, usage, and other relevant details from the information provided by Langchain. The `metadata` argument in Langchain calls can be used to pass additional information to Langfuse, including `langfuse_prompt` to link with managed prompts.

### Third-party integrations

The Langfuse SDK seamlessly integrates with any third-party library that uses OpenTelemetry instrumentation. When these libraries emit spans, they are automatically captured and properly nested within your trace hierarchy. This enables unified tracing across your entire application stack without requiring any additional configuration.

For example, if you're using OpenTelemetry-instrumented databases, HTTP clients, or other services alongside your LLM operations, all these spans will be correctly organized within your traces in Langfuse.

<Tabs items={["Example Anthropic", "Example LlamaIndex"]}>

<Tab>
You can use any third-party, OTEL-based instrumentation library for Anthropic to automatically trace all your Anthropic API calls in Langfuse.

In this example, we are using the [`opentelemetry-instrumentation-anthropic` library](https://pypi.org/project/opentelemetry-instrumentation-anthropic/).

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.anthropic import AnthropicInstrumentor

from langfuse import get_client

# This will automatically emit OTEL-spans for all Anthropic API calls
AnthropicInstrumentor().instrument()

langfuse = get_client()
anthropic_client = Anthropic()

with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="myspan"):
    # This will be traced as a Langfuse generation nested under the current span
    message = anthropic_client.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
        max_tokens=1024,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}],
    )

    print(message.content)

# Flush events to Langfuse in short-lived applications
langfuse.flush()
```

</Tab>

<Tab>
You can use the third-party, OTEL-based instrumentation library for LlamaIndex to automatically trace your LlamaIndex calls in Langfuse.

In this example, we are using the [`openinference-instrumentation-llama-index` library](https://pypi.org/project/openinference-instrumentation-llama-index/).

```python
from llama_index.core.llms.openai import OpenAI
from openinference.instrumentation.llama_index import LlamaIndexInstrumentor

from langfuse import get_client

LlamaIndexInstrumentor().instrument()

langfuse = get_client()
llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="myspan"):
    response = llm.complete("Hello, world!")
    print(response)

langfuse.flush()
```

## Scoring traces and observations

<Tabs items={["LangfuseSpan / LangfuseGeneration object methods", "Context-aware methods", "Low-level method"]}>

<Tab>
    - `span_or_generation_obj.score()`: Scores the specific observation object.
    - `span_or_generation_obj.score_trace()`: Scores the entire trace to which the object belongs.

    ```python
    from langfuse import get_client

    langfuse = get_client()

    with langfuse.start_as_current_generation(name="summary_generation") as gen:
        # ... LLM call ...
        gen.update(output="summary text...")
        # Score this specific generation
        gen.score(name="conciseness", value=0.8, data_type="NUMERIC")
        # Score the overall trace
        gen.score_trace(name="user_feedback_rating", value="positive", data_type="CATEGORICAL")
    ```

</Tab>

<Tab>
    - `langfuse.score_current_span()`: Scores the currently active observation in the context.
    - `langfuse.score_current_trace()`: Scores the trace of the currently active observation.

    ```python
    from langfuse import get_client

    langfuse = get_client()

    with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="complex_task") as task_span:
        # ... perform task ...
        langfuse.score_current_span(name="task_component_quality", value=True, data_type="BOOLEAN")
        # ...
        if task_is_fully_successful:
             langfuse.score_current_trace(name="overall_success", value=1.0, data_type="NUMERIC")
    ```

</Tab>

<Tab>
    - Creates a score for a specified `trace_id` and optionally `observation_id`.
    - Useful when IDs are known, or for scoring after the trace/observation has completed.

    from langfuse import get_client

    langfuse = get_client()

    langfuse.create_score(
        name="fact_check_accuracy",
        value=0.95, # Can be float for NUMERIC/BOOLEAN, string for CATEGORICAL
        trace_id="abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890",

See [Scoring](/docs/scores/overview) for more details.

## Datasets

[Langfuse Datasets](/docs/datasets/overview) are essential for evaluating and testing your LLM applications by allowing you to manage collections of inputs and their expected outputs.

### Interacting with Datasets

- **Fetching**: Retrieve a dataset and its items using `langfuse.get_dataset(name: str)`. This returns a `DatasetClient` instance, which contains a list of `DatasetItemClient` objects (accessible via `dataset.items`). Each `DatasetItemClient` holds the `input`, `expected_output`, and `metadata` for an individual data point.
- **Creating**: You can programmatically create new datasets with `langfuse.create_dataset(...)` and add items to them using `langfuse.create_dataset_item(...)`.

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()

# Fetch an existing dataset
dataset = langfuse.get_dataset(name="my-eval-dataset")
for item in dataset.items:
    print(f"Input: {item.input}, Expected: {item.expected_output}")

# Briefly: Creating a dataset and an item
new_dataset = langfuse.create_dataset(name="new-summarization-tasks")
langfuse.create_dataset_item(
    dataset_name="new-summarization-tasks",
    input={"text": "Long article..."},
    expected_output={"summary": "Short summary."}
)
```

### Linking Traces to Dataset Items for Runs

The most powerful way to use datasets is by linking your application's executions (traces) to specific dataset items when performing an evaluation run. See our [datasets documentation](/docs/datasets) for more details. The `DatasetItemClient.run()` method provides a context manager to streamline this process.

**How `item.run()` works:**

When you use `with item.run(run_name="your_eval_run_name") as root_span:`:

1.  **Trace Creation**: A new Langfuse trace is initiated specifically for processing this dataset item within the context of the named run.
2.  **Trace Naming & Metadata**:
    - The trace is automatically named (e.g., "Dataset run: your_eval_run_name").
    - Essential metadata is added to this trace, including `dataset_item_id` (the ID of `item`), `run_name`, and `dataset_id`.
3.  **DatasetRunItem Linking**: The SDK makes an API call to Langfuse to create a `DatasetRunItem`. This backend object formally links:
    - The `dataset_item_id`
    - The `trace_id` of the newly created trace
    - The provided `run_name`
    - Any `run_metadata` or `run_description` you pass to `item.run()`.
      This linkage is what populates the "Runs" tab for your dataset in the Langfuse UI, allowing you to see all traces associated with a particular evaluation run.
4.  **Contextual Span**: The context manager yields `root_span`, which is a `LangfuseSpan` object representing the root span of this new trace.
5.  **Automatic Nesting**: Any Langfuse observations (spans or generations) created _inside_ the `with` block will automatically become children of `root_span` and thus part of the trace linked to this dataset item and run.

**Example:**

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()
dataset_name = "qna-eval"
current_run_name = "qna_model_v3_run_05_20" # Identifies this specific evaluation run

# Assume 'my_qna_app' is your instrumented application function
def my_qna_app(question: str, context: str, item_id: str, run_name: str):
    with langfuse.start_as_current_generation(
        name="qna-llm-call",
        input={"question": question, "context": context},
        metadata={"item_id": item_id, "run": run_name}, # Example metadata for the generation
        model="gpt-4o"
    ) as generation:
        # Simulate LLM call
        answer = f"Answer to '{question}' using context." # Replace with actual LLM call
        generation.update(output={"answer": answer})

        # Update the trace with the input and output
        generation.update_trace(
            input={"question": question, "context": context},
            output={"answer": answer},
        )

        return answer

dataset = langfuse.get_dataset(name=dataset_name) # Fetch your pre-populated dataset

for item in dataset.items:
    print(f"Running evaluation for item: {item.id} (Input: {item.input})")

    # Use the item.run() context manager
    with item.run(
        run_name=current_run_name,
        run_metadata={"model_provider": "OpenAI", "temperature_setting": 0.7},
        run_description="Evaluation run for Q&A model v3 on May 20th"
    ) as root_span: # root_span is the root span of the new trace for this item and run.
        # All subsequent langfuse operations within this block are part of this trace.

        # Call your application logic
        generated_answer = my_qna_app(
            question=item.input["question"],
            context=item.input["context"],
            item_id=item.id,
            run_name=current_run_name
        )

        print(f"  Item {item.id} processed. Trace ID: {root_span.trace_id}")

        # Optionally, score the result against the expected output
        if item.expected_output and generated_answer == item.expected_output.get("answer"):
            root_span.score_trace(name="exact_match", value=1.0)
        else:
            root_span.score_trace(name="exact_match", value=0.0)

print(f"\nFinished processing dataset '{dataset_name}' for run '{current_run_name}'.")
```

By using `item.run()`, you ensure each dataset item's processing is neatly encapsulated in its own trace, and these traces are aggregated under the specified `run_name` in the Langfuse UI. This allows for systematic review of results, comparison across runs, and deep dives into individual processing traces.

## Advanced Configuration

### Masking Sensitive Data

If your trace data (inputs, outputs, metadata) might contain sensitive information (PII, secrets), you can provide a `mask` function during client initialization. This function will be applied to all relevant data before it's sent to Langfuse.

The `mask` function should accept `data` as a keyword argument and return the masked data. The returned data must be JSON-serializable.

```python
from langfuse import Langfuse
import re

def pii_masker(data: any, **kwargs) -> any:
    # Example: Simple email masking. Implement your more robust logic here.
    if isinstance(data, str):
        return re.sub(r"[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+", "[EMAIL_REDACTED]", data)
    elif isinstance(data, dict):
        return {k: pii_masker(data=v) for k, v in data.items()}
    elif isinstance(data, list):
        return [pii_masker(data=item) for item in data]
    return data

langfuse = Langfuse(mask=pii_masker)

# Now, any input/output/metadata will be passed through pii_masker
with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="user-query", input={"email": "test@example.com", "query": "..."}) as span:
    # The 'email' field in the input will be masked.
    pass
```

### Logging

The Langfuse SDK uses Python's standard `logging` module. The main logger is named `"langfuse"`.
To enable detailed debug logging, you can either:

1.  Set the `debug=True` parameter when initializing the `Langfuse` client.
2.  Set the `LANGFUSE_DEBUG="True"` environment variable.
3.  Configure the `"langfuse"` logger manually:

```python
import logging

langfuse_logger = logging.getLogger("langfuse")
langfuse_logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

The default log level for the `langfuse` logger is `logging.WARNING`.

### Sampling

You can configure the SDK to sample traces by setting the `sample_rate` parameter during client initialization (or via the `LANGFUSE_SAMPLE_RATE` environment variable). This value should be a float between `0.0` (sample 0% of traces) and `1.0` (sample 100% of traces).

If a trace is not sampled, none of its observations (spans, generations) or associated scores will be sent to Langfuse.

```python
from langfuse import Langfuse

# Sample approximately 20% of traces
langfuse_sampled = Langfuse(sample_rate=0.2)
```

### Filtering by Instrumentation Scope

You can configure the SDK to filter out spans from specific instrumentation libraries by using the `blocked_instrumentation_scopes` parameter. This is useful when you want to exclude infrastructure spans while keeping your LLM and application spans.

```python
from langfuse import Langfuse

# Filter out database spans
langfuse = Langfuse(
    blocked_instrumentation_scopes=["sqlalchemy", "psycopg"]
)
```

**How it works:**

When third-party libraries create OpenTelemetry spans (through their instrumentation packages), each span has an associated "instrumentation scope" that identifies which library created it. The Langfuse SDK filters spans at the export level based on these scope names.

You can see the instrumentation scope name for any span in the Langfuse UI under the span's metadata (`metadata.scope.name`). Use this to identify which scopes you want to filter.

<Callout type="warning">
**Cross-Library Span Relationships**

When filtering instrumentation scopes, be aware that blocking certain libraries may break trace tree relationships if spans from blocked and non-blocked libraries are nested together.

For example, if you block parent spans but keep child spans from a separate library, you may see "orphaned" LLM spans whose parent spans were filtered out. This can make traces harder to interpret.

Consider the impact on trace structure when choosing which scopes to filter.
</Callout>

### Isolated TracerProvider

You can configure a separate OpenTelemetry TracerProvider for use with Langfuse. This creates isolation between Langfuse tracing and your other observability systems.

**Benefits of isolation:**
- Langfuse spans won't be sent to your other observability backends (e.g., Datadog, Jaeger, Zipkin)
- Third-party library spans won't be sent to Langfuse
- Independent configuration and sampling rates

<Callout type="warning">
While TracerProviders are isolated, they share the same OpenTelemetry context for tracking active spans. This can cause span relationship issues where:
- A parent span from one TracerProvider might have children from another TracerProvider
- Some spans may appear "orphaned" if their parent spans belong to a different TracerProvider
- Trace hierarchies may be incomplete or confusing

Plan your instrumentation carefully to avoid confusing trace structures.
</Callout>

```python
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider

from langfuse import Langfuse

langfuse_tracer_provider = TracerProvider() # do not set to global tracer provider to keep isolation

langfuse = Langfuse(tracer_provider=langfuse_tracer_provider)

langfuse.start_span(name="myspan").end() # Span will be isolated from remaining OTEL instrumentation
```

### Multi-Project Setup (Experimental)

<Callout type="warning">
Multi-project setups are **experimental** and have important limitations regarding third-party OpenTelemetry integrations.
</Callout>

The Langfuse Python SDK supports routing traces to different projects within the same application by using multiple public keys. This works because the Langfuse SDK adds a specific span attribute containing the public key to all spans it generates.

**How it works:**

1. **Span Attributes**: The Langfuse SDK adds a specific span attribute containing the public key to spans it creates
2. **Multiple Processors**: Multiple span processors are registered onto the global tracer provider, each with their respective exporters bound to a specific public key
3. **Filtering**: Within each span processor, spans are filtered based on the presence and value of the public key attribute

**Important Limitation with Third-Party Libraries:**

Third-party libraries that emit OpenTelemetry spans automatically (e.g., HTTP clients, databases, other instrumentation libraries) do **not** have the Langfuse public key span attribute. As a result:

- These spans cannot be routed to a specific project
- They are processed by all span processors and sent to all projects
- All projects will receive these third-party spans

**Why is this experimental?**
This approach requires that the `public_key` parameter be passed to all Langfuse SDK executions across all integrations to ensure proper routing, and third-party spans will appear in all projects.

#### Initialization

To set up multiple projects, initialize separate Langfuse clients for each project:

```python
from langfuse import Langfuse

# Initialize clients for different projects
project_a_client = Langfuse(
    public_key="pk-lf-project-a-...",
    secret_key="sk-lf-project-a-...",
    host="https://cloud.langfuse.com"
)

project_b_client = Langfuse(
    public_key="pk-lf-project-b-...",
    secret_key="sk-lf-project-b-...",
    host="https://cloud.langfuse.com"
)
```

#### Integration Usage

For all integrations in multi-project setups, you must specify the `public_key` parameter to ensure traces are routed to the correct project.

**Observe Decorator:**

Pass `langfuse_public_key` as a keyword argument to the observed function (not the decorator):

```python
from langfuse import observe

@observe()
def process_data_for_project_a(data):
    # Processing logic
    return {"processed": data}

@observe()
def process_data_for_project_b(data):
    # Processing logic
    return {"enhanced": data}

# Route to Project A
result_a = process_data_for_project_a(
    data="input data",
    langfuse_public_key="pk-lf-project-a-..."
)

# Route to Project B
result_b = process_data_for_project_b(
    data="input data",
    langfuse_public_key="pk-lf-project-b-..."
)
```

**OpenAI Integration:**

Add `langfuse_public_key` as a keyword argument to the OpenAI execution:

```python
from langfuse.openai import openai

client = openai.OpenAI()

# Route to Project A
response_a = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello from Project A"}],
    langfuse_public_key="pk-lf-project-a-..."
)

# Route to Project B
response_b = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello from Project B"}],
    langfuse_public_key="pk-lf-project-b-..."
)
```

**Langchain Integration:**

Add `public_key` to the CallbackHandler constructor:

```python
from langfuse.langchain import CallbackHandler
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

# Create handlers for different projects
handler_a = CallbackHandler(public_key="pk-lf-project-a-...")
handler_b = CallbackHandler(public_key="pk-lf-project-b-...")

llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4o")
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("Tell me about {topic}")
chain = prompt | llm

# Route to Project A
response_a = chain.invoke(
    {"topic": "machine learning"},
    config={"callbacks": [handler_a]}
)

# Route to Project B
response_b = chain.invoke(
    {"topic": "data science"},
    config={"callbacks": [handler_b]}
)
```

**Important Considerations:**

- Every Langfuse SDK execution across all integrations must include the appropriate public key parameter
- Missing public key parameters may result in traces being routed to the default project or lost
- Third-party OpenTelemetry spans (from HTTP clients, databases, etc.) will appear in all projects since they lack the Langfuse public key attribute

### Self-signed SSL certificates (self-hosted Langfuse)


If you are [self-hosting](/docs/deployment/self-host) Langfuse and you'd like to use self-signed SSL certificates, you will need to configure the SDK to trust the self-signed certificate:

<Callout type='warning'>
Changing SSL settings has major security implications depending on your environment. Be sure you understand these implications before you proceed.
</Callout>

**1. Set OpenTelemetry span exporter to trust self-signed certificate**

```bash filename=".env"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_CERTIFICATE="/path/to/my-selfsigned-cert.crt"
```

**2. Set HTTPX to trust certificate for all other API requests to Langfuse instance**

```python filename="main.py"
import os

import httpx

from langfuse import Langfuse

httpx_client = httpx.Client(verify=os.environ["OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_CERTIFICATE"])

langfuse = Langfuse(httpx_client=httpx_client)
```

## OTEL and Langfuse

The Langfuse v3 SDK is built upon [OpenTelemetry (OTEL)](https://opentelemetry.io/), a standard for observability. Understanding the relation between OTEL and Langfuse is not required to use the SDK, but it is helpful to have a basic understanding of the concepts. OTEL related concepts are abstracted away and you can use the SDK without being deeply familiar with them.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph OTEL_Core_Concepts ["OpenTelemetry"]
        direction LR
        OTEL_Trace["OTEL Trace"]
        Root_OTEL_Span["Root OTEL Span"]

    class OTEL_Trace,Root_OTEL_Span,Child_OTEL_Span otel;
    class LF_Trace,LF_Observation langfuse;
```

- **OTEL Trace**: An OTEL-trace represents the entire lifecycle of a request or transaction as it moves through your application and its services. A trace is typically a sequence of operations, like an LLM generating a response followed by a parsing step. The root (first) span created in a sequence defines the OTEL-trace. OTEL-traces do not have a start and end time, they are defined by the root span.
- **OTEL Span**: A span represents a single unit of work or operation within a trace. Spans have a start and end time, a name, and can have attributes (key-value pairs of metadata). Spans can be nested to create a hierarchy, showing parent-child relationships between operations.
- **Langfuse Trace**: A Langfuse trace collects observations and holds trace attributes such as `session_id`, `user_id` as well as overall input and outputs. It shares the same ID as the OTEL trace and its attributes are set via specific OTEL span attributes that are automatically propagated to the Langfuse trace.
- **Langfuse Observation**: In Langfuse terminology, an "observation" is a Langfuse-specific representation of an OTEL span. It can be a generic span (Langfuse-span) or a specialized "generation" (Langfuse-generation) or a point in time event (Langfuse-event)
  - **Langfuse Span**: A Langfuse-span is a generic OTEL-span in Langfuse, designed for non-LLM operations.
  - **Langfuse Generation**: A Langfuse-generation is a specialized type of OTEL-span in Langfuse, designed specifically for Large Language Model (LLM) calls. It includes additional fields like `model`, `model_parameters`, `usage_details` (tokens), and `cost_details`.
  - **Langfuse Event**: A Langfuse-event tracks a point in time action.
- **Context Propagation**: OpenTelemetry automatically handles the propagation of the current trace and span context. This means when you call another function (whether it's also traced by Langfuse, an OTEL-instrumented library, or a manually created span), the new span will automatically become a child of the currently active span, forming a correct trace hierarchy.

The Langfuse SDK provides wrappers around OTEL spans (`LangfuseSpan`, `LangfuseGeneration`) that offer convenient methods for interacting with Langfuse-specific features like scoring and media handling, while still being native OTEL spans under the hood. You can also use these wrapper objects to add Langfuse trace attributes.

## Upgrade from v2

The v3 SDK introduces significant improvements and changes compared to v2. It is **not fully backward compatible**. This comprehensive guide will help you migrate based on your current integration.

**Core Changes to SDK v2:**

- **OpenTelemetry Foundation**: v3 is built on OpenTelemetry standards
- **Trace Input/Output**: Now derived from root observation by default
- **Trace Attributes** (`user_id`, `session_id`, etc.) Can be set via enclosing spans OR directly on integrations using metadata fields (OpenAI call, Langchain invocation)
- **Context Management**: Automatic OTEL context propagation

### Migration Path by Integration Type

#### `@observe` Decorator Users

**v2 Pattern:**

```python
from langfuse.decorators import langfuse_context, observe

@observe()
def my_function():
    # This was the trace
    langfuse_context.update_current_trace(user_id="user_123")
    return "result"
```

**v3 Migration:**

```python
from langfuse import observe, get_client # new import

@observe()
def my_function():
    # This is now the root span, not the trace
    langfuse = get_client()

    # Update trace explicitly
    langfuse.update_current_trace(user_id="user_123")
    return "result"
```

#### OpenAI Integration

**v2 Pattern:**

```python
from langfuse.openai import openai

response = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    # Trace attributes directly on the call
    user_id="user_123",
    session_id="session_456",
    tags=["chat"],
    metadata={"source": "app"}
)
```

**v3 Migration:**

If you do not set additional trace attributes, no changes are needed.

If you set additional trace attributes, you have two options:

**Option 1: Use metadata fields (simplest migration):**

```python
from langfuse.openai import openai

response = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    metadata={
        "langfuse_user_id": "user_123",
        "langfuse_session_id": "session_456",
        "langfuse_tags": ["chat"],
        "source": "app"  # Regular metadata still works
    }
)
```

**Option 2: Use enclosing span (for more control):**

```python
from langfuse import get_client
from langfuse.openai import openai

langfuse = get_client()

with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="chat-request") as span:
    # Set trace attributes on the enclosing span
    span.update_trace(
        user_id="user_123",
        session_id="session_456",
        tags=["chat"],
        # Explicit trace input/output for LLM-as-a-judge features
        input={"query": "Hello"},
    )

    response = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
        metadata={"source": "app"}
    )

    # Set trace output explicitly
    span.update_trace(output={"response": response.choices[0].message.content})
```

#### LangChain Integration

**v2 Pattern:**

```python
from langfuse.callback import CallbackHandler

handler = CallbackHandler(
    user_id="user_123",
    session_id="session_456",
    tags=["langchain"]
)

response = chain.invoke({"input": "Hello"}, config={"callbacks": [handler]})
```

**v3 Migration:**

You have two options for setting trace attributes:

**Option 1: Use metadata fields in chain invocation (simplest migration):**

```python
from langfuse.langchain import CallbackHandler

handler = CallbackHandler()

response = chain.invoke(
    {"input": "Hello"},
    config={
        "callbacks": [handler],
        "metadata": {
            "langfuse_user_id": "user_123",
            "langfuse_session_id": "session_456",
            "langfuse_tags": ["langchain"]
        }
    }
)
```

**Option 2: Use enclosing span (for more control):**

```python
from langfuse import get_client
from langfuse.langchain import CallbackHandler

langfuse = get_client()

with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="langchain-request") as span:
    span.update_trace(
        user_id="user_123",
        session_id="session_456",
        tags=["langchain"],
        input={"query": "Hello"}  # Explicit trace input
    )

    handler = CallbackHandler()
    response = chain.invoke({"input": "Hello"}, config={"callbacks": [handler]})

    # Set trace output explicitly
    span.update_trace(output={"response": response})
```

#### LlamaIndex Integration Users

**v2 Pattern:**

```python
from langfuse.llama_index import LlamaIndexCallbackHandler

handler = LlamaIndexCallbackHandler()
Settings.callback_manager = CallbackManager([handler])

response = index.as_query_engine().query("Hello")
```

**v3 Migration:**

```python
from langfuse import get_client
from openinference.instrumentation.llama_index import LlamaIndexInstrumentor

# Use third-party OTEL instrumentation
LlamaIndexInstrumentor().instrument()

langfuse = get_client()

with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="llamaindex-query") as span:
    span.update_trace(
        user_id="user_123",
        input={"query": "Hello"}
    )

    response = index.as_query_engine().query("Hello")

    span.update_trace(output={"response": str(response)})
```

#### Low-Level SDK Users

**v2 Pattern:**

```python
from langfuse import Langfuse

langfuse = Langfuse()

trace = langfuse.trace(
    name="my-trace",
    user_id="user_123",
    input={"query": "Hello"}
)

generation = trace.generation(
    name="llm-call",
    model="gpt-4o"
)
generation.end(output="Response")
```

**v3 Migration:**

<Callout type="info">
  In v3, all spans / generations must be ended by calling `.end()` on the
  returned object.
</Callout>

```python
from langfuse import get_client

langfuse = get_client()

# Use context managers instead of manual objects
with langfuse.start_as_current_span(
    name="my-trace",
    input={"query": "Hello"}  # Becomes trace input automatically
) as root_span:
    # Set trace attributes
    root_span.update_trace(user_id="user_123")

    with langfuse.start_as_current_generation(
        name="llm-call",
        model="gpt-4o"
    ) as generation:
        generation.update(output="Response")

    # If needed, override trace output
    root_span.update_trace(output={"response": "Response"})
```

### Key Migration Checklist

1. **Update Imports**:

   - Use `from langfuse import get_client` to access global client instance configured via environment variables
   - Use `from langfuse import Langfuse` to create a new client instance configured via constructor parameters
   - Use `from langfuse import observe` to import the observe decorator
   - Update integration imports: `from langfuse.langchain import CallbackHandler`

2. **Trace Attributes Pattern**:

   - **Option 1**: Use metadata fields (`langfuse_user_id`, `langfuse_session_id`, `langfuse_tags`) directly in integration calls
   - **Option 2**: Move `user_id`, `session_id`, `tags` to enclosing spans and use `span.update_trace()` or `langfuse.update_current_trace()`

3. **Trace Input/Output**:

   - **Critical for LLM-as-a-judge**: Explicitly set trace input/output
   - Don't rely on automatic derivation from root observation if you need specific values

4. **Context Managers**:

   - Replace manual `langfuse.trace()`, `trace.span()` with context managers if you want to use them
   - Use `with langfuse.start_as_current_span()` instead

5. **LlamaIndex Migration**:

   - Replace Langfuse callback with third-party OTEL instrumentation
   - Install: `pip install openinference-instrumentation-llama-index`

6. **ID Management**:

   - **No Custom Observation IDs**: v3 uses W3C Trace Context standard - you cannot set custom observation IDs
   - **Trace ID Format**: Must be 32-character lowercase hexadecimal (16 bytes)
   - **External ID Correlation**: Use `Langfuse.create_trace_id(seed=external_id)` to generate deterministic trace IDs from external systems

   ```python
   from langfuse import Langfuse, observe

   # v3: Generate deterministic trace ID from external system
   external_request_id = "req_12345"
   trace_id = Langfuse.create_trace_id(seed=external_request_id)

   @observe(langfuse_trace_id=trace_id)

       # This trace will have the deterministic ID
       pass
   ```

7. **Initialization**:
   - Replace constructor parameters:
     - `enabled` → `tracing_enabled`
     - `threads` → `media_upload_thread_count`

### Detailed Change Summary

1.  **Core Change: OpenTelemetry Foundation**

    - Built on OpenTelemetry standards for better ecosystem compatibility

2.  **Trace Input/Output Behavior**

    - **v2**: Integrations could set trace input/output directly
    - **v3**: Trace input/output derived from root observation by default
    - **Migration**: Explicitly set via `span.update_trace(input=..., output=...)`

3.  **Trace Attributes Location**

    - **v2**: Could be set directly on integration calls
    - **v3**: Must be set on enclosing spans
    - **Migration**: Wrap integration calls with `langfuse.start_as_current_span()`

4.  **Creating Observations**:

    - **v2**: `langfuse.trace()`, `langfuse.span()`, `langfuse.generation()`
    - **v3**: `langfuse.start_as_current_span()`, `langfuse.start_as_current_generation()`
    - **Migration**: Use context managers, ensure `.end()` is called or use `with` statements

5.  **IDs and Context**:

    - **v3**: W3C Trace Context format, automatic context propagation
    - **Migration**: Use `langfuse.get_current_trace_id()` instead of `get_trace_id()`

6.  **Event Size Limitations**:
    - **v2**: Events were limited to 1MB in size
    - **v3**: No size limits enforced on the SDK-side for events

### Future support for v2

We will continue to support the v2 SDK for the foreseeable future with critical bug fixes and security patches. We will not be adding any new features to the v2 SDK.

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Issues**:
  - Ensure `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, and `LANGFUSE_HOST` (if not using default cloud) are correctly set either as environment variables or in the `Langfuse()` constructor.
  - Use `langfuse.auth_check()` after initialization to verify credentials. Do not use this in production as this method waits for a response from the server.
- **No Traces Appearing**:
  - Check if `tracing_enabled` is `True` (default).
  - Verify `sample_rate` is not `0.0`.
  - Ensure `langfuse.shutdown()` is called or the program exits cleanly to allow `atexit` hooks to flush data. Manually call `langfuse.flush()` to force data sending.
  - Enable debug logging (`debug=True` or `LANGFUSE_DEBUG="True"`) to see SDK activity and potential errors during exporting.
- **Incorrect Nesting or Missing Spans**:
  - Ensure you are using context managers (`with langfuse.start_as_current_span(...)`) for proper context propagation.
  - If manually creating spans (`langfuse.start_span()`), ensure they are correctly ended with `.end()`.
  - In async code, ensure context is not lost across `await` boundaries if not using Langfuse's async-compatible methods.
- **Langchain/OpenAI Integration Not Working**:
  - Confirm the respective integration (e.g., `from langfuse.openai import openai` or `LangfuseCallbackHandler`) is correctly set up _before_ the calls to the LLM libraries are made.
  - Check for version compatibility issues between Langfuse, Langchain, and OpenAI SDKs.
- **Media Not Appearing**:
  - Ensure `LangfuseMedia` objects are correctly initialized and passed in `input`, `output`, or `metadata`.
  - Check debug logs for any media upload errors. Media uploads happen in background threads.

If you encounter persistent issues, please:

1.  Enable debug logging to gather more information.
2.  Check the Langfuse status page (if applicable for cloud users).
3.  Raise an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/issues) with details about your setup, SDK version, code snippets, and debug logs.

# Typescript SDK

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  As an example, we integrated the Typescript SDK into a fork of the Chatbot UI
  project ([GitHub](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-demo-nextjs)):
  <ul>
    <li className="list-disc ml-8">
      [`chat.ts`](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-demo-nextjs/blob/main/pages/api/chat.ts)
      (tracing of LLM calls)
    </li>
    <li className="list-disc ml-8">
      [`ChatMessage.tsx`](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-demo-nextjs/blob/main/components/Chat/ChatMessage.tsx#L40-L59)
      (feedback collection in frontend)
    </li>
  </ul>
</Callout>

## 1. Initializing the client

The langfuse SDKs are hosted in a private npm registry by [Fern](https://buildwithfern.com/). Add the registry to your project before installing them.

```bash
# add a .npmrc file to your project root
touch .npmrc

# add a config to the file
echo "@finto-fern:registry=https://npm.buildwithfern.com" >> .npmrc
```

### Server

The server client can modify all entities in the Langfuse API and requires the secret key. The secret key must not be exposed to users.

```bash
# install the packages
npm install @finto-fern/langfuse-node
```

```typescript filename="server.ts"
import { LangfuseClient } from "@finto-fern/langfuse-node";

const serverClient = new LangfuseClient({
  environment: "https://cloud.langfuse.com", // or any custom host, e.g. http://localhost:3030
  username: env.LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY, // pk-lf-...
  password: env.LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY, // pk-sk-...
});
```

### Frontend

The frontend client can be used to send scores directly to the Langfuse API. This is useful when scores are based on user feedback that is explicitly or implicitly given in the frontend. It is initialised with the public key which can be exposed to users.

```bash
# install the packages
npm install @finto-fern/react-client
```

```typescript filename="frontend.ts"
import { LangfuseClient } from "@finto-fern/react-client";

const frontendClient = new LangfuseClient({
  environment: "https://cloud.langfuse.com", // or any custom host, e.g. http://localhost:3030
  token: env.LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY, // pk-lf-...
});
```

## 2. Trace execution of backend

- Each backend execution is logged with a single `trace`.
- Each trace can contain multiple `observations` to log the individual steps of the execution.
  - Observations can be nested.
  - Observations can be of different types
    - `Events` are the basic building block. They are used to track discrete events in a trace.
    - `Spans` represent durations of units of work in a trace.
    - `Generations` are spans which are used to log generations of AI model. They contain additional attributes about the model and the prompt/completion and are specifically rendered in the langfuse UI.

### Traces

Traces are the top-level entity in the Langfuse API. They represent an execution flow in a LLM application usually triggered by an external event.

Traces can be created and updated.

`trace.create()` takes the following parameters:

- `name` (optional): identifier of the trace. Useful for sorting/filtering in the UI.
- `metadata` (optional): additional metadata of the trace. Can be any JSON object.
- `externalId` (optional): the id of the execution in the external system. Useful for linking traces to external systems. Frequently used to create scores without having access to the langfuse `traceId`.

```typescript filename="server.ts"
const trace = await serverClient.trace.create({
  name: "chat-app-session",
  metadata: { env: "production", user: "6784367" },
});
```

### Observations

### Events

Events are used to track discrete events in a trace.

- `traceId` (optional): the id of the trace to which the event should be attached. If no traceId is provided, the event will be attached to a new trace.
- `startTime`: the time at which the event started.
- `name` (optional): identifier of the event. Useful for sorting/filtering in the UI.
- `metadata` (optional): additional metadata of the event. JSON object.
- `level` (optional): the level of the event. Can be `DEBUG`, `DEFAULT`, `WARNING` or `ERROR`. Used for sorting/filtering of traces with elevated error levels and for highlighting in the UI.
- `statusMessage` (optional): the status message of the event. Additional field for context of the event. E.g. the error message of an error event.
- `parentObservationId` (optional): the id of the span or event to which the event should be attached
- `input` (optional): the input to the event. Can be any JSON object.
- `output` (optional): the output to the event. Can be any JSON object.

```typescript filename="server.ts"
await serverClient.event.create({
  traceId: trace.id,
  startTime: new Date(),
  name: "get-user-profile",
  metadata: {
    attempt: 2,
    httpRoute: "/api/retrieve-doc",
  },
  parentObservationId: llmCall.id,
  input: {
    userId: "user__935d7d1d-8625-4ef4-8651-544613e7bd22",
  },
  output: {
    firstName: "Max",
    lastName: "Mustermann",
    email: "max.mustermann@gmail.com",
  },
});
```

### Span

Spans represent durations of units of work in a trace. We generated convenient SDK functions for generic spans as well as LLM spans.

`span.create()` take the following parameters:

- `traceId` (optional): the id of the trace to which the span should be attached. If no traceId is provided, the span will be attached to a new trace.
- `startTime` (optional): the time at which the span started. If no startTime is provided, the current time will be used.
- `endTime` (optional): the time at which the span ended. Can also be set using `span.update()`.
- `name` (optional): identifier of the span. Useful for sorting/filtering in the UI.
- `metadata` (optional): additional metadata of the span. Can be any JSON object. Can also be set or updated using `span.update()`.
- `level` (optional): the level of the span. Can be `DEBUG`, `DEFAULT`, `WARNING` or `ERROR`. Used for sorting/filtering of traces with elevated error levels and for highlighting in the UI.
- `statusMessage` (optional): the status message of the span. Additional field for context of the event. E.g. the error message of an error event.
- `parentObservationId` (optional): the id of the observation to which the span should be attached
- `input` (optional): the input to the span. Can be any JSON object.
- `output` (optional): the output to the span. Can be any JSON object.

```typescript filename="server.ts"
const retrievalStartTime = new Date();

// const retrievedDoc = await retrieveDoc();

const retrieval = await client.span.create({
  traceId: trace.id,
  startTime: retrievalStartTime,
  endTime: new Date(),
  name: "embedding-retrieval",
  metadata: {
    httpRoute: "/api/retrieve-doc",
  },
  input: {
    userId: "user__935d7d1d-8625-4ef4-8651-544613e7bd22",
  },
  output: {
    firstName: "Max",
    lastName: "Mustermann",
    email: "max.mustermann@gmail.com",
  },
});
```

`span.update()` take the following parameters:

- `spanId`: the id of the span to update
- `endTime` (optional): the time at which the span ended
- `metadata` (optional): merges with existing metadata of the span. Can be any JSON object.

### Generation

Generations are used to log generations of AI model. They contain additional attributes about the model and the prompt/completion and are specifically rendered in the langfuse UI.

`generation.log()` take the following parameters:

- `traceId` (optional): the id of the trace to which the generation should be attached. If no traceId is provided, the generation will be attached to a new trace.
- `startTime` (optional): the time at which the generation started.
- `endTime` (optional): the time at which the generation ended.
- `name` (optional): identifier of the generation. Useful for sorting/filtering in the UI.
- `model` (optional): the name of the model used for the generation
- `modelParameters` (optional): the parameters of the model used for the generation; can be any key-value pairs
- `prompt` (optional): the prompt used for the generation; can be any string or JSON object (recommended for chat models or other models that use structured input)
- `completion` (optional): the completion generated by the model
- `usage` (optional): the usage of the model during the generation; takes two optional key-value pairs: `promptTokens` and `completionTokens`
- `metadata` (optional): additional metadata of the generation. Can be any JSON object.
- `level` (optional): the level of the generation. Can be `DEBUG`, `DEFAULT`, `WARNING` or `ERROR`. Used for sorting/filtering of traces with elevated error levels and for highlighting in the UI.
- `statusMessage` (optional): the status message of the generation. Additional field for context of the event. E.g. the error message of an error event.
- `parentObservationId` (optional): the id of the observation to which the generation should be attached as a child.

```typescript filename="server.ts"
const generationStartTime = new Date();

// const chatCompletion = await llm.respond(prompt);

const generation = await client.generations.log({
  traceId: trace.id,
  startTime: generationStartTime,
  endTime: new Date(),
  name: "chat-completion",
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  modelParameters: {
    temperature: 0.9,
    maxTokens: 2000,
    topP: undefined,
  },
  prompt: messagesToSend,
  completion: chatCompletion.data.choices[0].message?.content,
  usage: {
    promptTokens: chatCompletion.data.usage?.prompt_tokens,
    completionTokens: chatCompletion.data.usage?.completion_tokens,
  },
  metadata: {
    userId: "user__935d7d1d-8625-4ef4-8651-544613e7bd22",
  },
});
```

## 3. Collect scores

Scores are used to evaluate executions/traces. They are always attached to a single trace. If the score relates to a specific step of the trace, the score can optionally also be atatched to the observation to enable evaluating it specifically.

- `traceId`: the id of the trace to which the score should be attached
- `name`: identifier of the score, string
- `value`: the value of the score; float; optional: scale it to e.g. 0..1 to make it comparable to other scores
- `observationId` (optional): the id of the span, event or generation to which the score should be attached
- `traceIdType` (option): the type of the traceId. Can be `LANGFUSE` (default) or `EXTERNAL`. If `EXTERNAL` is used, the score will be attached to the trace with the given externalId.

Scores can also be modified by the serverClient.

```typescript filename="frontend.ts"
await frontendClient.score.create({
  traceId: message.traceId,
  name: "user-feedback",
  value: 1,
  observationId: llmCall.id,
});
```

## 4. Optimize performance

When tracing complex applications, the number of observations can quickly grow large. To optimize performance, the SDK shall best be used asynchronously and not be awaited. Then it should add only minimal overhead to the execution of the application.

```typescript filename="server.ts"
const langfusePromises = [];

// execution

langfusePromises.push(
  serverClient.event.create({
    // ...
  })
);

// respond to user

// await all langfuse calls
await Promises.all(langfusePromises);
```

For nesting of observations, the creation of the parent observation needs to be awaited before creating the child observation, we are working on the batch creation of observations to further optimize performance.

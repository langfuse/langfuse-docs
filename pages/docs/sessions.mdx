# Sessions

Many interactions with LLM applications span multiple traces. `Sessions` in Langfuse are a way to group these traces together and see a simple **session replay** of the entire interaction. Get started by adding a `sessionId` when creating a trace.

Try this feature using the public [example project](/docs/demo).

## How it works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A(Session) -->|1:n, sessionId| B(Trace)
```

Add a `sessionId` when creating/updating a trace. This can be any string that you use to identify the session. All traces with the same `sessionId` will be grouped together.

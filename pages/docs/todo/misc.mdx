### Reporting

- Monitor usage (cost control)
- Track latency, quality (based on user feedback) and OpenAI errors

### Tracing

Each response is based on the following steps which can go wrong, be slow or expensive:

1. Embedding of user request
2. Embedding similarity search in Postgres
3. Summary of docs as markdown
4. Generation of response based on retrieved context and chat history

This is how a single trace looks like in Langfuse:

### User feedback collection

In this example, we can see how we do:

1. Collection of feedback using the Langfuse Web SDK
   > _Negative, Langchain not included in response_
2. Browsing of feedback
3. Identification of the root cause of the low-quality response
   > Docs on Langchain integration are not included in embedding similarity search

## Example

We integrated the Typescript SDK into the Vercel AI Chatbot project. Check out the [blog post](/blog/showcase-llm-chatbot) for screenshots and detailed explanations of the inner workings of the integration. The project includes:

- Streamed responses from OpenAI
- Conversations
- Collection of user feedback on individual messages using the Web SDK

## Making calls

- Each backend execution is logged with a single [trace](#trace).
- Each trace can contain multiple `observations` to log the individual steps of the execution.
  - [Observations](#observations) can be of different types
    - [Events](#event) are the basic building block. They are used to track discrete events in a trace.
    - [Spans](#span) represent durations of units of work in a trace.
    - [Generations](#generation) are spans which are used to log generations of AI model. They contain additional attributes about the model and the prompt/completion and are specifically rendered in the Langfuse UI.
  - Observations can be [nested](#nesting).

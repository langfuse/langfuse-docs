# Agent Graphs

Agent graphs in Langfuse provide a visual representation of complex AI agent workflows, helping you understand and debug multi-step reasoning processes and agent interactions.

## Get Started

<Callout type="info">

The graph view is currently in beta and supports LangGraph. We are working on a more generalized implementation and expanding support for other frameworks in the future.

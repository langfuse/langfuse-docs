# Comments on Objects

Comments enable teams to add contextual notes and discussions directly to traces, observations, sessions, and prompts within Langfuse. This feature facilitates collaboration by allowing team members to:

- Flag issues or anomalies in specific traces
- Share insights about particular model outputs
- Document edge cases and debugging notes
- Coordinate on prompt improvements
- Leave feedback during development and review cycles

## Supported Object Types

Comments can be added to the following Langfuse objects:

- **Traces** - Comment on complete execution flows
- **Observations** - Add notes to specific LLM calls, spans, or events
- **Sessions** - Discuss user interaction patterns
- **Prompts** - Collaborate on prompt versions and improvements

## Adding Comments

<Tabs items={["UI", "API"]}>

Each supported object page displays a comment button in the interface. The button shows:
- The current comment count (capped at "99+" for readability)
- A disabled state if you don't have read permissions
- An active state when comments are available or you can create them

Clicking the comment button opens a side drawer containing:

1. **Comment Thread** - All existing comments displayed chronologically
2. **Composer** - Text area for writing new comments (if you have write permissions)
3. **Markdown Preview** - Real-time preview of your formatted comment

<Callout type="info">
  Comment authors can only delete their own comments. Project admins cannot delete other users' comments through the UI.

The Comments API allows programmatic access to create and retrieve comments. All endpoints follow the standard Langfuse API patterns.

```http
POST /api/public/comments
```

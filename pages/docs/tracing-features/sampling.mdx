# Sampling

Sampling can be used to control the volume of traces collected by the Langfuse server. 


You can configure the sample rate by setting the `LANGFUSE_SAMPLE_RATE` environment variable or by using the `sample_rate` parameter in the constructors of the Python SDK. The value has to be between 0 and 1. The default value is 1, meaning that all traces are collected. A value of 0.2 means that only 20% of the traces are collected. The SDK samples on the trace level meaning that if a trace is sampled, all observations and scores within that trace will be sampled as well.

Support for the JS SDK is coming soon.

When using the [`@observe()` decorator](/docs/sdk/python/decorators):

```python
from langfuse.decorators import langfuse_context, observe

os.environ["LANGFUSE_SAMPLE_RATE"] = '0.5'

@observe()
def fn():
    pass

fn()
```

When using the [low-level SDK](/docs/sdk/python/low-level-sdk):

```python
from langfuse import Langfuse

# Either set the environment variable or the constructor parameter. The latter takes precedence.
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SAMPLE_RATE"] = '0.5'
langfuse = Langfuse(sample_rate=0.5)

trace = langfuse.trace(
  name="Rap Battle",
)
```

When using the [OpenAI SDK Integration](/docs/integrations/openai)

```python
# Either set the environment variable or configure the openai import. The latter takes precedence.
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SAMPLE_RATE"] = '0.5'

from langfuse.openai import openai
openai.langfuse_sample_rate = 0.5

completion = openai.chat.completions.create(
  name="test-chat",
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a calculator."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "1 + 1 = "}],
)

When using the [CallbackHandler](/docs/integrations/langchain/tracing)

```python
from langfuse.callback import CallbackHandler

# Either set the environment variable or the constructor parameter. The latter takes precedence.
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SAMPLE_RATE"] = '0.5'
handler = CallbackHandler(
  sample_rate=0.5
)
```

When using the [LlamaIndex Integration](/docs/integrations/llama-index)

```python
from llama_index.core import Settings
from llama_index.core.callbacks import CallbackManager
from langfuse import langfuse

# Either set the environment variable or the constructor parameter. The latter takes precedence.
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SAMPLE_RATE"] = '0.5'
langfuse_callback_handler = LlamaIndexCallbackHandler(sample_rate=0.5)

Settings.callback_manager = CallbackManager([langfuse_callback_handler])

title: LLM Observability & Application Tracing (open source)
description: Open Source LLM Observability and Tracing with Langfuse. Integrates with OpenAI, LlamaIndex, LangChain, Python Decorators and more.

# Introduction to Langfuse Tracing

LLM applications use increasingly complex abstractions, such as chains, agents with tools, and advanced prompts. **Nested traces** in Langfuse help to understand what is happening and identify the root cause of problems.

<details>
<summary>Why Use LLM Observability & Tracing?</summary>

- **Full context capture:** Track the complete execution flow including API calls, context, prompts, parallelism and more
- **Cost monitoring:** Track model usage and costs across your application
- **Quality insights:** Collect user feedback and identify low-quality outputs
- **Dataset creation:** Build high-quality datasets for fine-tuning and testing
- **Root cause analysis:** Quickly identify and debug issues in complex LLM applications

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why Langfuse?</summary>

- **Open source:** Fully open source with public API for custom integrations
- **Production optimized:** Designed with minimal performance overhead
- **Best-in-class SDKs:** Native SDKs for Python and JavaScript
- **Framework support:** Integrated with popular frameworks like OpenAI SDK, LangChain, and LlamaIndex

## Advanced usage

You can extend the tracing capabilities of Langfuse by using the following features:

import {
  Users,
  Tag,
  MessagesSquare,
  Images,
  Braces,
  GitGraph,
  Globe,
  Database,
  FileDigit,
  GitCompare,
} from "lucide-react";

## Enable/disable tracing

All Langfuse SDKs and integrations are designed to be non-intrusive. You can add Langfuse tracing to your application while being able to enable it only in specific environments.

By default, the Langfuse Tracing is enabled if an API key is set. You can manually disable tracing via the `enabled` flag. See the documentation for the specific SDK or integration for more details.

## Event queuing/batching [#queuing-batching]

Langfuse's client SDKs and integrations are all designed to queue and batch requests in the background to optimize API calls and network time. Batches are determined by a combination of time and size (number of events and size of batch).

### Configuration

All integrations have a sensible default configuration, but you can customise the batching behaviour to suit your needs.

| Option (Python) [SDK constructor, Environment]  | Option (JS)          | Description                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flush_at`, `LANGFUSE_FLUSH_AT`                 | `flushAt`            | The maximum number of events to batch up before sending. |
| `flush_interval`, `LANGFUSE_FLUSH_INTERVAL` (s) | `flushInterval` (ms) | The maximum time to wait before sending a batch.         |

You can e.g. set `flushAt=1` to send every event immediately, or `flushInterval=1000` to send every second.

### Manual flushing

<Callout type="info">
  This is especially relevant for short-lived applications like serverless
  functions. If you do not flush the client, you may lose events.
</Callout>

If you want to send a batch immediately, you can call the `flush` method on the client. In case of network issues, flush will log an error and retry the batch, it will never throw an exception.

{/* Python SDK v3 */}
```python
from langfuse import langfuse, get_client

langfuse = Langfuse()

# or access the client directly
langfuse = get_client()

# Flush all pending observations
langfuse.flush()
```

If you exit the application, use `shutdown` method to make sure all requests are flushed and pending requests are awaited before the process exits. On success of this function, no more events will be sent to Langfuse API.

```python
langfuse.shutdown()
```

</Tab>

<Tab>
{/* Python SDK v2 */}

```python
# Decorator
from langfuse.decorators import langfuse_context
langfuse_context.flush()

# low-level SDK
langfuse.flush()
```

If you exit the application, use `shutdown` method to make sure all requests are flushed and pending requests are awaited before the process exits. On success of this function, no more events will be sent to Langfuse API.

```python
langfuse.shutdown()
```

</Tab>
<Tab>
{/* JS/TS */}

```javascript
await langfuse.flushAsync();
```

If you exit the application, use `shutdownAsync` method to make sure all requests are flushed and pending requests are awaited before the process exits.

```javascript
await langfuse.shutdownAsync();
```

**If you run on Vercel**, the [`waitUntil()`](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/functions-api-reference#waituntil) method enqueues an asynchronous task to be performed during the lifecycle of the request. It doesn't block the response, but should complete before shutting down the function. Thereby, it ensures that all events are flushed before the function exits without delaying the response.

```sh
npm i @vercel/functions
```

```javascript
import { waitUntil } from "@vercel/functions";

export async function POST(req, res) {
  // your code involving langfuse

  // Flush events to Langfuse without blocking the response
  waitUntil(langfuse.flushAsync());

  // Send response to client
  return res.status(200).send("OK");
}
```

```

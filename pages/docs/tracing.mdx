# LLM Application Tracing

LLM applications use increasingly complex abstractions, such as chains, agents with tools, and advanced prompts. The nested traces in Langfuse help to understand what is happening and identify the root cause of problems.

## Why Use Tracing for an LLM Application?

- Capture the full context of the execution, including API calls, context, prompts, parallelism, and more
- Track model usage and cost
- Collect user feedback
- Identify low-quality outputs
- Build fine-tuning and testing datasets

## Why Langfuse?

- Open-source
- Low performance overhead
- SDKs for Python and JavaScript
- Integrated with popular frameworks: OpenAI SDK (Python), Langchain (Python, JS), LlamaIndex (Python)
- Public API for custom integrations
- Suite of tools for the whole LLM application development lifecycle

## Introduction to Traces in Langfuse

A trace in Langfuse consists of the following objects:

- A `trace` typically represents a single request or operation. It contains the overall input and output of the function, as well as metadata about the request, such as the user, the session, and tags.
- Each trace can contain multiple `observations` to log the individual steps of the execution.
  - Observations are of different types:
    - `Events` are the basic building blocks. They are used to track discrete events in a trace.
    - `Spans` represent durations of units of work in a trace.
    - `Generations` are spans used to log generations of AI models. They contain additional attributes about the model, the prompt, and the completion. For generations, [token usage and costs](/docs/model-usage-and-cost) are automatically calculated.
  - Observations can be nested.

## Get Started

Follow the quickstart to add Langfuse tracing to your LLM app.

import { Rocket, Joystick } from "lucide-react";

<Cards num={3}>
  <Card
    icon={<Rocket size="24" />}
    title="Quickstart"
    href="/docs/get-started"
    arrow
  />
  <Card
    icon={<Joystick size="24" />}
    title="Interactive demo"
    href="/docs/demo"
    arrow
  />
</Cards>

## Advanced usage

You can extend the tracing capabilities of Langfuse by using the following features:

import { Users, Tag, MessagesSquare, Braces, Globe } from "lucide-react";

<Cards num={3}>
  <Card
    title="Sessions"
    href="/docs/tracing-features/sessions"
    icon={<MessagesSquare />}
    arrow
  />
  <Card
    title="Users"
    href="/docs/tracing-features/users"
    icon={<Users />}
    arrow
  />
  <Card title="Tags" href="/docs/tracing-features/tags" icon={<Tag />} arrow />
  <Card
    title="Metadata"
    href="/docs/tracing-features/metadata"
    icon={<Braces />}

</Cards>

## Event queuing/batching [#queuing-batching]

Langfuse's client SDKs and integrations are all designed to queue and batch requests in the background to optimize API calls and network time. Batches are determined by a combination of time and size (number of events and size of batch).

### Configuration

All integrations have a sensible default configuration, but you can customise the batching behaviour to suit your needs.

| Option (Python)      | Option (JS)          | Description                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flush_at`           | `flushAt`            | The maximum number of events to batch up before sending. |
| `flush_interval` (s) | `flushInterval` (ms) | The maximum time to wait before sending a batch.         |

You can e.g. set `flushAt=1` to send every event immediately, or `flushInterval=1000` to send every second.

### Manual flushing

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Callout type="info">
  This is especially relevant for short-lived applications like serverless
  functions. If you do not flush the client, you may lose events.
</Callout>

If you want to send a batch immediately, you can call the `flush` method on the client. In case of network issues, flush will log an error and retry the batch, it will never throw an exception.

```python
# Decorator

If you exit the application, use `shutdown` method to make sure all requests are flushed and pending requests are awaited before the process exits. On success of this function, no more events will be sent to Langfuse API.

```python
langfuse.shutdown()
```

If you exit the application, use `shutdownAsync` method to make sure all requests are flushed and pending requests are awaited before the process exits.

# Tracing

LLM apps use increasingly complex abstractions (chains, agents with tools, advanced prompts). The nested traces in Langfuse help to understand what is going on and get to the root cause of problems.

## Introduction

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Trace "1" *-- "n" Observation
    Observation <|-- Event
    Observation <|-- Span
    Observation <|-- Generation
    Observation o-- Observation: Nesting
```

- Each backend execution is logged with a single `trace`.
- Each trace can contain multiple `observations` to log the individual steps of the execution.
  - Observations are of different types:
    - `Events` are the basic building block. They are used to track discrete events in a trace.
    - `Spans` represent durations of units of work in a trace.
    - `Generations` are spans which are used to log generations of AI models. They contain additional attributes about the model, the prompt/completion. For generations, [token usage](/docs/token-usage) is automatically calculated.
  - Observations can be nested.

Follow the integration docs to send traces to Langfuse. You can use:

- [Langfuse SDKs](/docs/sdk)
- [Langchain integration](/docs/langchain)
- [API](/docs/api)

## Example

Automatically traced with Langchain integration:

## Detect and fix problems

1. Collect user feedback from the frontend
2. Filter down to executions that had poor quality
3. Use the debugging UI to get to the root cause of the problem

## Share via public link

You can share a trace with anyone via a public link. The link is read-only.

## Get trace url in SDK

Sometimes, it is useful to get the trace URL directly in the SDK. E.g. to add it to your logs or interactively look at it when running experiments in notebooks.

```python
# trace object
trace.get_trace_url()
```

```python
# Langchain callback handler
handler.get_trace_url()
```

</Tab>
<Tab>
```typescript
// trace object
trace.getTraceUrl()
```

```typescript
// Langchain callback handler
handler.getTraceUrl();
```

## Tagging traces
Tags allow you to categorize and filter traces. You can tag traces only from the [Langfuse SDKs](/docs/sdk) or from the [Langfuse UI](https://cloud.langfuse.com). To tag a trace, add a list of tags to the tags field of the trace object. Tags are strings and a trace may have multiple tags.

<Tabs items={["Python", "JS/TS"]}>
<Tab>
```python
trace = langfuse.trace(
    name = "docs-retrieval",
    tags = ["my-first-tag", "even-better-tag"]
)
```

</Tab>

<Tab>
```typescript
const trace = langfuse.trace({
  name: "docs-retrieval",
  tags: ["tag-a-licious", "tig-tag-tagging"],
});
```

</Tab>

### Working with traces
Tags enable you to flexibly add metadata to your traces. 
You can filter for tags in the Langfuse UI. You can also group traces in the UI for comparison and pattern identification. 
Use descriptive tags and leverage the filtering and grouping capabilities of the Langfuse UI to enhance trace management and analysis workflows.

### Get started
When choosing tags, consider what aspects of the traces you might want to filter for or group by in your analysis. You may use tags to indicate specific versions of your app ('app-v1', 'app-v2'), specific LLM techniques you used ('rag', 'one-shot', 'few-shot'), or the environment of your app ('local', 'staging', 'prod').

# Trace URLs

import { CloudflareVideo } from "@/components/Video";

Each trace has a unique URL that you can use to share it with others or to access it directly.

## Get trace url

Sometimes, it is useful to get the trace URL directly in the SDK. E.g. to add it to your logs or interactively look at it when running experiments in notebooks.

```python
trace = langfuse.trace(...)
trace.get_trace_url()
```

```typescript
const trace = langfuse.trace(...)
trace.getTraceUrl()
```

Use the interoperability of the Langfuse SDK with the Langchain integration to get the URL of a trace ([interop docs](/docs/integrations/langchain/get-started#interoperability)).

```python
# Intialize Langfuse Client
from langfuse import Langfuse
langfuse = Langfuse()

# Create a Langfuse trace for an execution of your application
trace = langfuse.trace()

# Get Langchain handler for this trace
langfuse_handler = trace.get_langchain_handler()

# Get the trace URL
langfuse_handler.get_trace_url()
```

**Deprecated:** flaky in cases of concurrent requests as it depends on the state of the handler.

```
handler.get_trace_url()
```

## Share trace via url

By default, only members of your Langfuse project can view a trace.

You can make a trace `public` to share it via a public link. This allows others to view the trace without needing to log in or be members of your Langfuse project.

_Example: https://cloud.langfuse.com/public/traces/lf.docs.conversation.u6Wl2hG_

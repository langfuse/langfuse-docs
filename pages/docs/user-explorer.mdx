# Users

The Users view provides an overview of all users as well as an in-depth look into individual users.

Mapping data in Langfuse to individual users is easy by passing a unique identifier as the `userId` attribute when creating a `trace`. This can be a username, email address, or any other unique identifier. The `userId` attribute is optional, but it is highly recommended to use it to get the most out of Langfuse. Checkout the integration docs to learn more.

## View all users

The user list provides an overview of all users that have been tracked by Langfuse. It makes it simple to segment by overall token usage, number of traces, and user feedback.

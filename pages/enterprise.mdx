The Langfuse team provides Langfuse Cloud as a managed solution to simplify the initial setup of Langfuse and to minimize the operational overhead of maintaining high availability in production. You can choose to self-host Langfuse on your own infrastructure.

Some features are not available in the open-source version. Please refer to the overview [here](/pricing-self-host).

</details>

<details>
<summary>How does Authentication and RBAC work in Langfuse?</summary>

Langfuse offers a list of prebuilt roles which apply on an organizational and project level to restrict access ([RBAC documentation](/docs/rbac)).

If needed, environments (production, staging, development) can be separated into different projects in Langfuse to restrict access to production/sensitive data while making it easier to share development environments with the team and other stakeholders.

SSO with Langfuse is simple. Currently Google, GitHub, Azure AD, Okta, Auth0, AWS Cognito, Keycloak, and JumpCloud are supported. We can easily add additional providers based on your requirements. As an enterprise customer, you can also enforce SSO for your organization.

<details>
<summary>What is the easiest way to try Langfuse?</summary>

The Hobby Plan on [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com) includes enough resources to try Langfuse for free while in a non-production environment, no credit card required.

Alternatively, you can quickly spin up Langfuse on your own machine using `docker compose up` ([docs](/self-hosting/deployment/docker-compose)).

<details>
<summary>Common Enterprise LLM Platform Architecture</summary>

Langfuse aims to address the challenges of debugging, monitoring, and continuously improving LLM-based applications. It focuses on observability, evaluation, and prompt management.

Langfuse is often deployed alongside a central LLM Gateway that provides schema translation, rate limiting, and PII redaction. The LLM Gateway can be an internal service or an open-source project like LiteLLM. If you use LiteLLM, you can leverage the native integration ([docs](/integrations/gateways/litellm)).

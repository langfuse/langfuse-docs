# Langfuse in the Enterprise

The problems Langfuse solves are especially relevant to solve in when deploying LLM based applications in the context of an enterprise. As an open source project, Langfuse lends itself to be used in enterprises to shortcut data security and data privacy questions through self-hosting. This document provides an overview of common questions for working with Langfuse in the enterprise.

## FAQ

We try to collect the most common questions and answers here. If you have questions that are not answered here, please reach out to us: enteprise@langfuse.com

#### What is the difference between Langfuse Cloud and the open-source version?

The Langfuse team provides Langfuse Cloud as a managed solution to simplify the initial setup of Langfuse and to minimize the operational overhead of maintaining high availability in production. You can chose to self-host Langfuse on your own infrastructure.

#### What deployment options are available for Langfuse?

1. Managed Cloud (cloud.langfuse.com), see [Pricing](/pricing) page for details.
2. Single-tenant managed cloud, deployment managed by Langfuse team.
3. [Self-hosted](/docs/deployment/self-host) on your own infrastructure. Contact us if you are interested in optional support.

#### How does Authentication and RBAC work in Langfuse?

Langfuse offers a list of prebuilt roles which apply on a project level to restrict access ([RBAC documentation](/docs/rbac)).

If needed, environments (production, staging, development) can be separated into different projects in Langfuse to restrict access to production/sensitive data while making it easier to share development environments with the team and other stakeholders.

SSO with Langfuse is simple. Currently Google, GitHub, Azure AD are supported and this can easily be extended to other providers. As an enteprise customer, you can also enforce SSO for your organization.

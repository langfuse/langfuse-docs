#### What is the difference between Langfuse Cloud and the open-source version?

The Langfuse team provides Langfuse Cloud as a managed solution to simplify the initial setup of Langfuse and to minimize the operational overhead of maintaining high availability in production. You can chose to self-host Langfuse on your own infrastructure.

#### What is Langfuse's license?

We strive to be permissively licensed at our core. Langfuse is MIT-licensed. You can find more information on [our license](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme) and [our plans](https://langfuse.com/docs/open-source) in our documentation.

#### How does Authentication and RBAC work in Langfuse?

Langfuse offers a list of prebuilt roles which apply on a project level to restrict access ([RBAC documentation](/docs/rbac)).

If needed, environments (production, staging, development) can be separated into different projects in Langfuse to restrict access to production/sensitive data while making it easier to share development environments with the team and other stakeholders.

SSO with Langfuse is simple. Currently Google, GitHub, Azure AD are supported and this can easily be extended to other providers. As an enteprise customer, you can also enforce SSO for your organization.

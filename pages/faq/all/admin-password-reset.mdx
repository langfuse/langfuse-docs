# Can administrators reset user passwords in Langfuse?

For security reasons, Langfuse administrators **cannot directly reset user passwords**. This design protects user account security and follows security best practices.

## How users can reset their own passwords

### Langfuse Cloud

Users can reset their passwords independently by:

1. **Using the "Forgot Password" link** on the login page
2. **Selecting the correct data region** (EU or US)
3. **Checking their email** (including spam folder) for reset instructions
4. **Following the email link** to create a new password

If users don't receive the reset email, they should:
- Check spam/junk folders
- Verify they're using the correct email address
- Ensure they're on the right regional login page
- Contact support if issues persist: support@langfuse.com

### Self-hosted Langfuse

For self-hosted instances, password reset depends on your email configuration:

**If transactional emails are configured** (via `SMTP_CONNECTION_URL` and `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`):
- Users can use the "Forgot password" link normally
- The process works the same as Langfuse Cloud

**If transactional emails are NOT configured**:
- Administrators with database access can reset passwords manually
- Follow the steps in the [self-hosting authentication documentation](/self-hosting/security/authentication-and-sso)
- This requires direct database access and technical knowledge

## What administrators can do instead

While you can't reset passwords directly, administrators can:

### 1. Help users with account access
- Verify the user is using the correct email address
- Confirm they're accessing the right Langfuse region
- Check if their account is properly set up in the organization

### 2. Manage user accounts
- **Remove users** from the organization if needed
- **Re-invite users** with a fresh invitation
- **Update user roles** and permissions
- **Disable access** by removing from projects/organization

### 3. Provide SSO alternatives
- **Set up Single Sign-On** to reduce password dependency
- **Configure SAML or OIDC** for centralized authentication
- **Use identity provider** password reset capabilities

### 4. Assist with troubleshooting
- Help users identify the correct login method
- Verify SSO configuration if applicable
- Check for account-related issues in the system

## When to contact support

Contact Langfuse support if:
- Users consistently can't receive password reset emails
- There are technical issues with the password reset flow
- You need help with SSO configuration
- Users report persistent login problems after password reset

## Security considerations

This limitation exists because:
- **User privacy**: Only users should control their passwords
- **Security best practices**: Prevents unauthorized password changes
- **Audit compliance**: Maintains clear accountability for password changes
- **Reduced attack surface**: Limits administrative privileges

## Alternative solutions

### For organizations wanting centralized control:
1. **Implement SSO**: Use your existing identity provider for authentication
2. **Use SAML/OIDC**: Integrate with corporate authentication systems
3. **Directory integration**: Connect with Active Directory or similar systems

### For self-hosted deployments:
1. **Configure email properly**: Set up SMTP for automated password resets
2. **Database access procedures**: Establish secure processes for manual resets
3. **Backup authentication**: Consider multiple authentication methods

This design ensures that Langfuse maintains high security standards while providing users with reliable self-service password reset capabilities.

# How to authenticate with the Langfuse API?

You need to authenticate with the API using [Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication), get API keys in the project settings:

- username: Langfuse Public Key
- password: Langfuse Secret Key

## Example

```bash
curl -u "<public_key>:secret_key" https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/projects
```

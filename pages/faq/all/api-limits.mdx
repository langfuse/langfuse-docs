# Are there any limits to the Langfuse API?

While the Langfuse API is extremely open and flexible [1], there are some limits to ensure the stability and performance of the platform. The limits are as follows:

- Payloads: 5MB per request and 5MB per response
- Rate Limits:
  - On Langfuse Cloud
    - Hobby and Pro plans: 1000 requests per minute
    - Team plan: custom Limits
  - Self-hosted instances: no hard limits, depends on your infrastructure capacity

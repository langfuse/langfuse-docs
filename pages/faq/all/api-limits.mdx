# Are there any limits to the Langfuse API?

While the [Langfuse API](https://api.reference.langfuse.com) is extremely open and flexible, there are some limits to ensure the stability and performance of the platform.

## Langfuse Cloud

### Payloads

5MB per request and 5MB per response

### Rate Limits

| Plan                | Rate Limit               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Hobby and Pro plans | 1000 requests per minute |
| Team plan           | custom limits            |

Rate limit response

- HTTP status code 429
- `Retry-After` response header with the number of seconds to wait before retrying

## Self-hosted instances

No hard limits, depends on your infrastructure capacity and load-balancer configuration.

# Are there any limits to the Langfuse API?

While the [Langfuse API](https://api.reference.langfuse.com) is extremely open and flexible, there are some limits to ensure the stability and performance of the platform. If you run into unexpected limits, please reach out to us via the chat widget.

## Langfuse Cloud

### Payloads

5MB per request and 5MB per response

### Rate Limits

### Resource Types

- **ingestion:** This endpoint is used by SDKs to ingest traces.
- **prompts:** This is the API for SDKs to fetch prompts.
- **public-api:** These are all other APIs used by SDKs to fetch data.
- **public-api-metrics**: These are APIs used to fetch traces analytics data.
- **legacy-ingestion:** These are deprecated APIs used by V1 version SDKs. They will be removed with Langfuse V3. For more details, refer to the [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1902).

# Are there prebuilt ARM images available?

No, currently we do not publish official ARM images. However, you can build your own ARM images using the Dockerfile in the Langfuse repository. Please track the `production` branch for the latest changes while avoiding the `main` branch, which may contain unstable changes.

This [issue](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/issues/1954) tracks the progress of `arm64` support. Feel free to contribute if you are interested in this.

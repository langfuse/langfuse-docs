### Langfuse Strengths

- **Open-Source**: Langfuse's open-source nature allows developers to inspect, modify, and contribute to the codebase, providing transparency and flexibility.
- **No LLM Proxy**: Langfuse integrates [directly](/blog/2024-09-langfuse-proxy) with LLMs without introducing an intermediary proxy, reducing potential risks related to latency, downtime, and data privacy.
- **Comprehensive Observability**: Offers deep insights into model interactions by tracing not only LLM calls, but also related application processes.
- **Self-Hosting Flexibility**: Provides self-hosting options, ensuring organizations can maintain full control over data residency, compliance, and security ([Learn more](/self-hosting)).

### Braintrust Considerations

- **Proprietary Platform**: Braintrust is a closed source platform. This inherently limits transparency, customization and agency.
- **LLM Proxy**: Braintrust is focussed on an LLM proxy to access models from providers like OpenAI and Anthropic, introducing potential production risks:
  - **Latency and Uptime Risks**: The proxy layer can introduce additional points of failure or performance bottlenecks.
  - **Data Privacy Concerns**: Routing data through an external proxy may raise compliance issues, particularly for sensitive data.
  - **Dependency on Third-Party Services**: Changes in proxy service terms or availability can impact application reliability.
- **Self-Hosting Limitations**: Braintrust's self-hosting options are limited to their enterprise plan.

## Why Choose Langfuse Over Braintrust?

- **Production Ready**: Langfuse is designed for [production](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/summary/langfuse) use cases, with a focus on reliability, security, and control over infrastructure.
- **Transparency and Control**: With Langfuse being open-source, you have full transparency into the platform's operations and can rely on it for the long-term.
- **Flexible Integration**: Langfuse integrates directly with popular LLM frameworks and SDKs, fitting seamlessly into your existing workflows.
- **Reduced Production Risks**: By [deciding not to use an LLM proxy](/blog/2024-09-langfuse-proxy), Langfuse eliminates potential points of failure and security risks associated with proxy layers.

# Galileo AI Alternative? Langfuse vs. Galileo AI

This article compares Langfuse and Galileo AI, two platforms that help developers evaluate and monitor applications built on LLMs. 

While both platforms aim to improve LLM reliability, they differ in philosophy. **Galileo AI** is a proprietary, all-in-one platform focused on real-time intervention and automated metrics. **Langfuse** is an open-source, engineering-centric platform focused on flexibility, data control, and deep observability.

## At a Glance

|  | 🪢 Langfuse | Galileo AI |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Open Source** | **Yes** (MIT licensed, fully open codebase) | **No** (closed-source commercial platform) |
| **Deployment Flexibility** | Maximum flexibility: Cloud or Self-Hosting | Cloud Only, VPC or on-prem enterprise only |
| **Integrations** | 80+ [SDKs/integrations](/integrations) for OpenAI, LangChain, etc., via OpenTelemetry. [OpenTelemetry](/integrations/native/opentelemetry) support for maximum interoperability. | approx. 10 listed integrations & auto-instrumentation for popular providers like OpenAI, Anthropic |
| **Openness** | Not opinionated; designed to be flexible enough to cover all workflows and evaluation methods via SDKs/APIs | Opinionated approach with templated guardrail evaluators using proprietary models |
| **Scalability** | Built to scale (ClickHouse-based architecture handles >5B events/month) | No public information available |

## Galileo AI

</Frame>

Galileo AI positions itself as an enterprise-grade evaluation and governance solution. Its core value proposition revolves around **reliability** and **safety**.

* **Real-Time Protection:** Galileo’s standout feature is its built-in "Protect" system, which uses proprietary Luna-2 models to intercept and block hallucinations or toxic outputs in real-time before they reach the user.  
* **Automated Evaluation:** It provides an opinionated workflow with pre-packaged metrics, allowing data science teams to get scores out of the box without engineering custom judges.

## Langfuse

Langfuse is the open-source standard for LLM observability. It is designed for engineering teams that want to treat LLM traces like any other application log - providing full visibility without vendor black boxes.

* **Observability:** Langfuse captures the full lifecycle of an LLM interaction - prompts, model responses, tool calls, and latency.  
* **Engineering-First Workflow:** It supports complex debugging (tracing chain-of-thought), prompt management, and diverse evaluation methods (human feedback, SDK methods, or any LLM-as-a-Judge).  
* **Scalability:** Built on a high-performance architecture (ClickHouse), Langfuse handles millions of events with minimal latency, ensuring it scales with your production traffic.

## Summary

**Choose Galileo AI if:** You are a data science team that needs a "turnkey" solution for safety. If you require real-time guardrails to block bad responses and prefer a managed, opinionated set of evaluation metrics out of the box, Galileo’s specific focus on governance is a strong fit.  

**Choose Langfuse if:** You are an engineering team building production applications. If you value open-source software, require flexible and unopinionated workflows, and need a platform that scales effortlessly with your traffic while allowing you to define your own evaluation logic, Langfuse is the robust, developer-centric choice.

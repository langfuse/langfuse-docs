### What is Helicone?

Helicone is an open source project for language model observability that provides a managed LLM proxy to log a variety of language models. Helicone offers their product as a managed cloud solution with a free plan [(up to 10k requests / month)](https://www.helicone.ai/pricing).

### What is Helicone used for?

- Logging an analysis of LLM outputs via the Helicone managed [LLM proxy](https://docs.helicone.ai/getting-started/integration-method/gateway).
- Ingestion and collection of user feedback through the Helicone feedback API.

### Pros and Cons of Helicone

| ✅ Advantages: | ⛔️ Limitations: |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Implementation:** Simple and quick setup process for LLM logging. <br/><br/>**Managed Proxy:** Monitoring though the Helicone managed proxy supporting caching, security checks, and key management. | **Limited Tracing Capabilities:** Provides only basic LLM logging with session grouping, lacking detailed traces. <br/><br/>**Lacks Deep Integration:** Does not support decorator or framework integrations for automatic trace generation. <br/><br/>**Evaluation Constraints:** Restricted to adding custom scores via the API with no support for LLM-as-a-judge methodology or manual annotation workflows. |

### What is Langfuse?

Langfuse is an LLM observability platform that provides a comprehensive tracing and logging solution for LLM applications. Langfuse helps teams to understand and debug complex LLM applications and evaluate and iterate them in production.

### What is Langfuse used for?

- Holistic tracing and debugging of LLM applications in large-scale production environments.
- High data security and compliance requirements in enterprises through best-in-class self-hosting options.
- Fast prototyping and iterating on LLM applications in small teams.

### Pros and Cons of Langfuse

| ✅ Advantages: | ⛔️ Limitations: |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Comprehensive Tracing:** Effectively tracks both LLM and non-LLM actions, delivering [complete context](/docs/tracing) for applications. <br/><br/>**Integration Options**: Supports asynchronous logging and tracing SDKs with integrations for frameworks like [Langchain](/docs/integrations/langchain/tracing), [Llama Index](/docs/integrations/llama-index/get-started), [OpenAI SDK](/docs/integrations/openai/python/get-started), and [others](/docs/integrations/overview). <br/><br/>**Prompt Management:** Optimized for minimal latency and uptime risk, with [extensive capabilities](/docs/prompts/get-started). <br/><br/>**Deep Evaluation:** Facilitates user feedback collection, manual reviews, automated annotations, and [custom evaluation](/docs/scores/overview) functions. <br/><br/>**Self-Hosting:** Extensive [self-hosting documentation](/docs/deployment/feature-overview) of required for data security or compliance requirements. | **Additional Proxy Setup:** Some LLM-related features like caching and key management require an external proxy setup, such as LiteLLM, which [integrates natively with Langfuse](/docs/integrations/litellm/tracing). Langfuse is not in the critical path and does not provide these features. <br/><br/>Read more on our opinion on LLM proxies in production settings [here](/blog/2024-09-langfuse-proxy). |

## Core Feature Comparison

This table compares the core features of LLM observability tools: Logging model calls, managing and testing prompts in production, and evaluating model outputs.

|  | Helicone | Langfuse |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| [Tracing and Logging](/docs/tracing) | Offers **basic LLM logging** capabilities with the ability to group logs into sessions. However, it does not provide detailed tracing and lacks support for framework integrations that would allow enhanced tracing functionalities. | Specializes in **comprehensive tracing**, enabling detailed tracking of both LLM and other activities within the system. Langfuse captures the **complete context** of applications and supports asynchronous logging with tracing SDKs, offering richer insights into application behavior. |
| [Prompt Management](/docs/prompts/get-started) | Currently in beta, it introduces **latency and uptime risks** if prompts are fetched at runtime without using their proxy. Users are required to manage prompt-fetching mechanisms independently.  | Delivers robust prompt management solutions through client SDKs, ensuring **minimal impact on application latency** and uptime during prompt retrieval.  |
| [Evaluation Capabilities](/docs/scores/overview) | Supports the addition of **custom scores** via its API, but does not offer advanced evaluation features beyond this basic capability. | Provides a wide array of evaluation tools, including mechanisms for **user feedback**, both **manual and automated annotations**, and the ability to define **custom evaluation functions**, enabling a richer and more thorough assessment of LLM performance. |

## Conclusion

Langfuse is a good choice for most **production use cases**, particularly when comprehensive **tracing**, deep **evaluation** capabilities, and robust **prompt management** are critical. Its ability to provide detailed insights into both **LLM and non-LLM activities**, along with support for **asynchronous logging** and various framework **integrations**, makes it ideal for complex applications requiring thorough observability. 

For teams prioritizing **ease of implementation** and willing to accept the trade-offs of increased risk and limited observability, Helicone's managed LLM proxy offers a **simpler setup** with features like caching and key management.

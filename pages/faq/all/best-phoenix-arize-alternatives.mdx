# Arize Phoenix Alternative? Langfuse vs. Arize AI for LLM Observability

This article compares [Arize Phoenix](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix) and [Langfuse](/), two **open source** LLM observability platforms.

## High Level Comparison

Arize Phoenix and Langfuse are both open-source tools for LLM observability, analytics, evaluation, testing, and annotation. However, they differ in focus, adoption, and suitability for different stages of LLM application development.

**Langfuse** focuses on being **best in class** for core LLM engineering features (tracing, evaluations, prompt management, APIs), prompt management, and usage analytics. **Arize Phoenix** focuses on the **experimental and development** stages of LLM apps and is particularly strong for RAG use cases.

- **Self-Hosting**: Langfuse is very easy to self-host and offers extensive [self-hosting documentation](/self-hosting) for data security or compliance requirements.

- **Integration with Arize**: Arize Phoenix is a good solution if your company already uses [Arize AI's](https://arize.com) platform. Phoenix enables a smooth data transfer between the two tools. However, it lacks **prompt management** and **LLM usage monitoring** features, which may limit its effectiveness in production environments.

- **Adoption and Production Readiness**: Langfuse has a larger open source adoption compared to Arize Phoenix and is considered [battle-tested](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-de/radar/platforms/langfuse) for production use cases. This makes Langfuse a good choice for companies seeking a reliable tool for live production environments.

## Conclusion

**Langfuse** is a great choice for most **production use cases**, particularly when comprehensive **tracing**, **prompt management**, deep **evaluation** capabilities, and robust **usage monitoring** are critical. Its ability to provide detailed insights into both **LLM and non-LLM activities**, along with support for asynchronous logging and various framework integrations, makes it ideal for complex applications requiring thorough observability.

**Arize Phoenix** is a strong option if your company already uses **Arize AI's enterprise platform** and is focused on the **experimental and development stages** of LLM applications. It offers tools for evaluation and troubleshooting . However, its **lack of prompt management** and **comprehensive LLM usage monitoring** features may limit its effectiveness in production environments, making it less suitable for teams requiring these capabilities.

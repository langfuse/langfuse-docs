# Arize Phoenix Alternative? Langfuse vs. Phoenix LLM Observability

This article compares [Arize Phoenix](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix) and [Langfuse](/), two **open source** LLM observability platforms.

## High Level Comparison

Arize Phoenix and Langfuse are both open-source tools for LLM observability, analytics, evaluation, testing, and annotation. However, they differ in focus, adoption, and suitability for different stages of LLM application development.

- **Focus**: 
  - Langfuse focuses on being **best in class** for core LLM engineering features (tracing, evaluations, prompt management, APIs), prompt management, and usage analytics.
  - Arize Phoenix focuses on the **experimental and development** stages of LLM apps.

- **Self-Hosting**: Langfuse is very easy to self-host and offers extensive [self-hosting documentation](/docs/deployment/feature-overview) for data security or compliance requirements.

- **Integration with Arize**: Arize Phoenix is a good solution if your company already uses [Arize AI's](https://arize.com) platform. Phoenix enables a smooth data transfer between the two tools. However, it lacks **prompt management** and **LLM usage monitoring** features, which may limit its effectiveness in production environments.

- **Adoption and Production Readiness**: Langfuse has a larger open source adoption compared to Arize Phoenix and is considered [battle-tested](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-de/radar/platforms/langfuse) for production use cases. This makes Langfuse a good choice for companies seeking a reliable tool for live production environments.

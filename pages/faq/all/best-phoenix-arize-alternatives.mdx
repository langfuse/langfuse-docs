# Arize AX Alternative? Langfuse vs. Arize for LLM Observability

This guide outlines the key differences between **[Langfuse](/)** and **[Arize AX](https://arize.com/llm-observability/)** to help engineering teams choose the right LLM observability platform.

**TL;DR:**

* **Choose Langfuse** if you prioritize open-source flexibility, transparent pricing based on usage, and a developer-first experience with extensive integrations and full self-hosting capabilities.
* **Choose Arize AX** if you need a managed SaaS solution with specialized support for financial compliance (PCI DSS) and deep integration into existing ML data fabrics.

## Open Source & Distribution

Langfuse stands out for its open-source model, ensuring feature parity between self-hosted and cloud versions. Arize AX is a proprietary enterprise SaaS, while its open-source counterpart ([Arize Phoenix](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix)) is primarily for local testing and debugging (uses PostgreSQL instead of ClickHouse).

| Feature | Langfuse | Arize AX |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Model** | **[Open Source](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse)** (MIT License) | **Proprietary SaaS** (Open-source "[Phoenix](https://github.com/arize-ai/phoenix)" is for local dev only) |
| **GitHub Stars** | [![Langfuse GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/langfuse/langfuse?style=for-the-badge&label=%20&labelColor=black&color=orange)](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse) | [![Phoenix GitHub stars (Phoenix)](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/arize-ai/phoenix?style=for-the-badge&label=%20&labelColor=black&color=grey)](https://github.com/arize-ai/phoenix)|
| **PyPI Downloads** | [![Langfuse pypi downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/langfuse?style=for-the-badge&label=%20&labelColor=black&color=orange)](https://pypi.org/project/langfuse/) | [![Phoenix pypi downloads (Phoenix)](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/arize-phoenix?style=for-the-badge&label=%20&labelColor=black&color=grey)](https://pypi.org/project/arize-phoenix) |
| **npm Downloads** | [![Langfuse npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/langfuse?style=for-the-badge&label=%20&labelColor=black&color=orange)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/langfuse) | N/A |
| **Docker Pulls** | [![Langfuse Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/langfuse/langfuse?style=for-the-badge&label=%20&labelColor=black&color=orange)](https://hub.docker.com/r/langfuse/langfuse) | [![Phoenix Docker Pulls (Phoenix)](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/arizephoenix/phoenix?style=for-the-badge&label=%20&labelColor=black&color=grey)](https://hub.docker.com/r/arizephoenix/phoenix) |
| **Self-Hosting** | **First-Class Citizen**: Full feature parity with Cloud (including ClickHouse). Easy to [deploy via Docker](/self-hosting). | Limited, [Phoenix only](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/deployment). No feature parity with Arize AX Cloud. |

## Scalability & Performance

Both tools are built for scale, but they use different architectural approaches. Langfuse is part of ClickHouse and leverages the speed of ClickHouse architecture, while Arize AX uses a proprietary database.

| Feature | Langfuse | Arize AX |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Backend** | **[ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/)** ([acquired Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/blog/joining-clickhouse)): Optimized for high-throughput OLAP. | **[adb (Arize Database)](https://arize.com/blog/introducing-adb-arizes-proprietary-olap-database)**: Proprietary engine for agentic telemetry. |

## Integrations

Langfuse focuses on broad, community-driven compatibility via OpenTelemetry, whereas Arize AX emphasizes auto-instrumentation and deep data warehouse links.

| Feature | Langfuse | Arize AX |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Standard** | **[OpenTelemetry Native](/docs/observability/overview)**: Built on OTel standards. | **[OpenTelemetry Native](https://arize.com/docs/ax/integrations/opentelemetry/overview)**: Built on OTel standards. |
| **Frameworks** | **[80+ Frameworks](/integrations)**: with popular frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. | Maintains integrations via [OpenInference library](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference). |

## Pricing

Langfuse offers a transparent, volume-based pricing model that scales predictably. Arize AX charges based on span counts and data volume, which can become costly for data-heavy LLM apps.

| Feature | Langfuse | Arize AX |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Model** | **Usage-Based**: [Billable unit](/docs/administration/billable-units) = trace, observation, or score. | **Hybrid**: Spans + Data Ingestion Volume (GB). |
| **Free Tier** | 50k traces/mo free to test the full platform. | 25k spans/mo and 1 GB data. |
| **Scalability** | Graduated pricing (e.g., $6/100k units at scale). Transparent overages. | N/A |
| **Plans** | [Free, Core ($29/mo), Pro ($199/mo), Teams, Enterprise](/pricing). | [Free, Pro ($50/mo), Enterprise](https://arize.com/pricing/). |

## Open Platform & Extensibility

Langfuse is designed as a core infrastructure component, allowing teams to build custom internal tools on top of its API.

| Feature | Langfuse | Arize AX |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **API Access** | [API first](/docs/api-and-data-platform/features/public-api) for all data (traces, evals, prompts) and platform features. | [API available](https://docs.arize.com/arize/api-reference/generative/overview), to export to data warehouses. |
| **Customizability** | Build custom workflows, evaluations, and [dashboards](/docs/metrics/features/custom-dashboards) using the SDK/API. | Custom evaluations and pipelines via SDK. |
| **Data Access** | Query via API and [blob storage exports](/docs/api-and-data-platform/features/export-to-blob-storage). | Query via API and blob storage exports. |


## Enterprise Security

Both platforms serve large enterprises, but Arize AX has a slight edge in specific financial certifications (PCI DSS). Langfuse supports [masking](https://langfuse.com/docs/observability/features/masking) to filter out PCI DSS sensitive data.

| Feature | Langfuse | Arize AX |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Certifications** | **[SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001](/security)**, GDPR, HIPAA aligned. | [SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, **PCI DSS 4.0**, CSA Star Level 1](https://arize.com/trust/). |
| **Adoption** | Trusted by **19 of Fortune 50** & 63 of Fortune 500. | Strong enterprise adoption, particularly in fintech. |
| **Governance** | [SSO](/docs/administration/authentication-and-sso), [RBAC](/docs/administration/rbac), [Audit Logs](/docs/administration/audit-logs) available in Teams/Enterprise plans. | SSO, RBAC available in Enterprise plans. |

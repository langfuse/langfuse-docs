# I Cannot See My Organization in Langfuse

## I'm a member but can't see my organization

If you've been added as a member to an organization but can't see it in your dashboard, there are several common causes and solutions to check.

### Are you on the correct Langfuse Cloud region?

Langfuse operates in multiple data regions. Make sure you're logged into the same region where your organization was created.

We run Langfuse in two data regions:
- **European Union**: [https://cloud.langfuse.com](https://cloud.langfuse.com)
- **United States**: [https://us.cloud.langfuse.com](https://us.cloud.langfuse.com)

You can see which region you're currently on by checking the URL in your browser. If you're not sure which region your organization is in, try logging into both regions to see where your organization appears.

### Are you using the correct email address?

Organization invitations are sent to specific email addresses. Make sure you're logging in with the exact email address that received the invitation.

**Common issues:**
- Your SSO provider (Google, GitHub, etc.) might use a different email than you expected
- You might have multiple email addresses and the invitation was sent to a different one
- Check your invitation email to confirm which address it was sent to

**To verify your current email address:**
1. Click your profile in the bottom left of the Langfuse UI
2. Check the email address displayed there
3. Ensure it matches the email that received the organization invitation

### Check your invitation email

Look for the organization invitation email in your inbox (including spam/junk folders). The invitation will contain:
- The organization name
- A link to accept the invitation
- The specific email address it was sent to

If you can't find the invitation email, ask your organization admin to resend it.

## Still having issues?

If you've verified your cloud region and email address but still can't see your organization, please reach out to our support team with the following information:

- Your email address
- Organization name you're trying to access
- Which cloud region you believe the organization is in

# I Cannot See My Organization in Langfuse

If you've been added as a member to an organization but can't see it in your dashboard, there are several common causes and solutions to check.

## Are you on the correct Langfuse Cloud region?

Langfuse operates in multiple data regions and all data is fully isolated. Make sure you're logged into the same region where your organization was created.

Learn more about [Langfuse Cloud Data Regions](/security/data-regions).

## Are you using the correct email address?

Organization invitations are sent to specific email addresses. Make sure you're logging in with the exact email address that received the invitation.

**Common issues:**

- Your SSO provider (Google, GitHub, etc.) might use a different email than you expected
- You might have multiple email addresses and the invitation was sent to a different one
- Check your invitation email to confirm which address it was sent to

**To verify your current email address:**

1. Click your profile in the bottom left of the Langfuse UI
2. Check the email address displayed there
3. Ensure it matches the email that received the organization invitation

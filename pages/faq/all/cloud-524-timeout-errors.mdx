# What does the 524 timeout error mean on Langfuse Cloud?

The 524 error class on Langfuse Cloud indicates that your request timed out because ClickHouse ran out of resources while processing your query. This typically occurs when queries scan too much data due to overly broad filter conditions.

<Callout type="info">
  **Self-hosted users**: While this FAQ focuses on the 524 error on Langfuse
  Cloud, similar timeout and resource exhaustion issues can occur on self-hosted
  instances. The solutions described here apply to both Cloud and self-hosted
  deployments. For self-hosted scaling guidance, see the [Scaling
  documentation](/self-hosting/configuration/scaling).
</Callout>

## Common Causes

The 524 error most frequently appears when:

- **Missing timestamp filters**: Queries without time constraints scan the entire dataset
- **Large session or trace queries**: Fetching traces without proper filters can load massive amounts of data
- **Broad API queries**: Using the public API without adequate filtering parameters
- **Requesting all fields**: Loading scores, observations, and metrics data together requires expensive joins

## General Solutions

To prevent 524 errors across all API endpoints:

1. **Always use timestamp filters**: Add `fromTimestamp` and `toTimestamp` parameters to limit the time range
2. **Reduce page size**: Lower the `limit` parameter to fetch fewer results per request
3. **Add specific filters**: Use `userId`, `sessionId`, `name`, `tags`, or other filters to narrow your query
4. **Paginate results**: Process data in smaller batches rather than fetching everything at once

## Specific Guidance for GET /api/public/traces

The [`GET /api/public/traces`](https://api.reference.langfuse.com/#tag/trace/get/api/public/traces) endpoint is particularly susceptible to 524 errors. Follow these best practices:

<Callout type="warning">
  **Critical**: Always include both `fromTimestamp` and `toTimestamp` parameters
  when querying traces. Without time filters, queries will attempt to scan your
  entire dataset and are very likely to timeout.
</Callout>

### Use Timestamp Filters

The tracing data is indexed by projectId and time, making timestamp filters essential for performance.

```bash
# Bad: Will scan entire dataset
GET /api/public/traces?page=1&limit=10

# Good: Scans only specific time range
GET /api/public/traces?page=1&limit=10&fromTimestamp=2025-10-16T00:00:00.000Z&toTimestamp=2025-10-17T00:00:00.000Z
```

### Optimize Field Selection

Use the `fields` parameter to request only the data you need. This significantly reduces query complexity and avoids expensive joins.

**Available field groups:**
- `core` (always included): Basic trace information
- `io`: Input, output, and metadata
- `scores`: Score data
- `observations`: Observation data
- `metrics`: Computed metrics

```bash
# Bad: Fetches all data including expensive joins
GET /api/public/traces?fromTimestamp=...&toTimestamp=...

# Good: Fetches only core and input/output data
GET /api/public/traces?fromTimestamp=...&toTimestamp=...&fields=core,io
```

### Combine Multiple Filters

Layer additional filters to further reduce the dataset:

```bash
GET /api/public/traces?fromTimestamp=2025-10-16T00:00:00.000Z&toTimestamp=2025-10-17T00:00:00.000Z&environment=production&userId=user123&limit=50
```

### Alternative Approach for Large Sessions

If you need to fetch all traces for a large session, consider this two-step approach:

1. Use `fields=core` to get trace IDs quickly
2. Fetch individual trace details using `GET /api/public/traces/{traceId}`
3. Or access the trace files directly from blob storage if you have self-hosted access

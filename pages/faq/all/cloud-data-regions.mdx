# What data regions does Langfuse Cloud support?

Langfuse supports the following data regions:

- **US, Northern California (AWS us-west-1)**: https://us.cloud.langfuse.com
- **Europe, Frankfurt, Germany (AWS eu-central-1)**: https://cloud.langfuse.com

All data, user accounts, and infrastructure are completely separated between these two regions. You can have accounts in both regions.

## How do I connect to a specific data region?

To connect to a specific data region, you need to set the `LANGFUSE_HOST` (Python) or `LANGFUSE_BASEURL` (JS/TS) in your environment configuration or when intializing the SDKs. Here are examples for both regions:

## What to take into account when selecting a data region

When selecting a data region, consider the following factors:

- Compliance and data privacy requirements
- Latency when fetching prompts from Langfuse prompt management
- Latency when working in the Langfuse interface

Less of a concern:

- Tracing ingestion latency as these requests are batched and sent in the background

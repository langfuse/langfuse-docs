# How do I cut my Langfuse Cloud bill?

Langfuse Cloud [pricing](/pricing) is based on the number of ingested tracing units per billing period.

`Billable Units = Traces + Observations + Scores` ([data model](/docs/tracing-data-model))

Most cost spikes result from ingesting **too many traces or overly verbose observations**.
You can **cut costs quickly by sampling fewer traces or logging only essential data**â€”all while preserving your core insights.

You can track your unit consumption in real-time via the "Langfuse Usage Management" dashboard:

## Option 1: Reduce observations per trace

Every observation within a trace counts toward your unit total. Some observations may be overly detailed or irrelevant to your specific use case. Steps to remove them:

1. Review your traces to identify low-value or unnecessary observations.
2. Update your integration/instrumentation to exclude these observations.

## Option 2: Sample fewer traces

Keeping all traces is often valuable for LLM application development. Unlike traditional observability:

- Dynamic sampling based on error levels isn't feasible since you only know if a trace is interesting after completion (through user feedback, LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, etc.).
- Retaining all traces supports model distillation efforts down the line.

However, if your application operates at significant scale, sampling can be a reasonable cost-cutting strategy. Check out the [sampling docs](/docs/tracing-features/sampling) to learn more.

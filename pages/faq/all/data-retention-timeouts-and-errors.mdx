# Why is my data retention job running into timeouts?

The data retention job uses the `blob_storage_file_log` table to remove event data from S3/blob storage when the corresponding events expire.
This is a potentially long-running query that may timeout.

If you use a lifecycle policy on your blob storage buckets _and_ have a [TTL configured](https://clickhouse.com/docs/guides/developer/ttl)  on the
`blob_storage_file_log` table, you can skip this processing step.
You can set `LANGFUSE_ENABLE_BLOB_STORAGE_FILE_LOG=false` to disable this functionality.

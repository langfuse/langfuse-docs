# How to delete a Langfuse Account?

## Langfuse Cloud

Before requesting account deletion, you must first delete or remove yourself from all organizations.

Once you have removed yourself from all organizations, please reach out via the [in-app support widget](/support) to request deletion of your account.

## Delete Projects

You can delete your projects (and any data associated with them) by going to the project settings and clicking on the "Delete Project" button.

## Self-hosted Langfuse

If you are using a self-hosted Langfuse instance, you will need to delete any data associated with your projects manually from your database.

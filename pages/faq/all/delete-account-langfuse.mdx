# How to delete a Langfuse Account?

## Langfuse Cloud

You can delete your account from the Account Settings page. Navigate to Account Settings from the user menu or visit `/account/settings`.

Account deletion is only possible if:
- You are not part of any organization, OR
- You are not the sole owner of any organization

If you are the sole owner of an organization, first transfer ownership to another user or delete the organization ([docs](/docs/administration/data-deletion#deleting-an-organization)).

## Self-hosted Langfuse

If you are using a self-hosted Langfuse instance, you will need to delete any data associated with your projects manually from your database.

# How to delete a Langfuse Account

## Langfuse Cloud

Please send us an email from the email address you used to sign up for Langfuse to support@langfuse.com requesting a deletion of your account.

## Delete Projects

You can delete your projects (and any data associated with them) by going to the project settings and clicking on the "Delete Project" button.

## Self-hosted Langfuse

If you are using a self-hosted Langfuse instance, you will need to delete any data associated with your projects manually from your database.

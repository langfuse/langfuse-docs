# How to enable or disable Langfuse tracing?

All Langfuse SDKs and integrations are designed to be non-intrusive. You can add Langfuse tracing to your application while being able to enable it only in specific environments.

## Default Behavior

By default, Langfuse tracing is **enabled** if you use one of the Langfuse SDKs and an API key is set.

## Disabling Tracing

You can manually disable tracing by setting the `LANGFUSE_TRACING_ENABLED` environment variable to `false`:

```bash
export LANGFUSE_TRACING_ENABLED=false
```

Or in your application configuration:

```bash
LANGFUSE_TRACING_ENABLED=false
```

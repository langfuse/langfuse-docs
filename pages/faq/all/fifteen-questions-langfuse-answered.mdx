# 18 Questions about Langfuse Answered

## 1. Is Langfuse Open Source?

**The answer is yes, Langfuse is open source.** Its entire code-base is available on the [Langfuse GitHub Repository](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/). The vast majority of Langfuse's code is permissively licensed under the MIT license.

Langfuse follows an open-core licensing model. The core of Langfuse, its tracing, integrations, API, data model and exports are MIT-licensed. Some features on Langfuse's periphery such as the model-based evaluation service or the Prompt Playground are commercially licensed and can only be used in Langfuse Cloud or need to be purchased to be used when Self-Hosting. Find more information on this here.

Learn more about our open-source strategy [here](/docs/open-source).

## 2. Can I use Langfuse for Prompt Management?

**Yes, Langfuse comes with built-in, powerful [Prompt Management](/docs/prompts/get-started) capabilities.** Langfuse allows you to effectively manage and version your prompts.

The main benefits of using Prompt Management with your LLM apps are:

- Decoupling: deploy new prompts without redeploying your application.
- Non-technical users can create and update prompts via Langfuse Console.
- Quickly rollback to a previous version of a prompt.

Find out more about how to start using [Langfuse Prompt Managment here](/docs/prompts/get-started).

For Langchain Users: You can use Langfuse to add Prompt Management to Langchain. Prompt Management works both for [Langchain Python](/docs/prompts/example-langchain) and [Langchain JS](/docs/prompts/example-langchain-js)

## 3. How can I run LLM Evaluations?

**You can use Langfuse for evaluations of your LLM applications.** Langfuse offers several powerful evaluation capabilities:

- **Model-based evaluations**: [Automate evaluations of all incoming traces](/docs/scores/model-based-evals#ui). Use pre-built templates for common criteria like hallucinations, toxicity, relevance, correctness
  - Create custom evaluation templates tailored to your specific needs
  - Apply evaluations to filtered subsets of your traces
  - Run evaluations asynchronously within Langfuse's infrastructure
- **Evaluation Libraries**: You can use Langfuse's Python SDK to run evaluations [using popular eval libraries](/docs/scores/model-based-evals#evaluation-pipeline) such as:
  - OpenAI Evals
  - Langchain Evaluators
  - RAGAS (for RAG applications)
  - UpTrain evals

**In addition to automated and programmatic evaluations, Langfuse supports:**

- [**Collecting user feedback**](/docs/scores/user-feedback)
- [**Manually labelling observations within the Langfuse UI**](/docs/scores/annotation) (Human annotation, data labelling, manual evaluation)
- You can always [export your scores](/docs/export-and-fine-tuning) to use them for analysis or downstream use cases

## 4. Is Langfuse an Alternative to Langsmith?

**The answer is yes, Langfuse is an open source alternative to Langsmith.** Langsmith is a closed source project maintained by the team behind Langchain. Langfuse is an independent open source product.

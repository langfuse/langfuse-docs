# I have forgotten my password

## Langfuse Cloud

If you've forgotten your password, you can reset it by following the "Forgot password" link on the login page. This will send you an email with instructions to reset your password. Please make sure to select the correct data region.

Please contact us if you encounter any issues: support@langfuse.com

## Self-hosted Langfuse Instance

**If transactional emails are configured** on your instance via the `SMTP_CONNECTION_URL` and `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` environments ([docs](/self-hosting/transactional-emails)), you can reset your password by using the "Forgot password" link on the login page.

**If transactional emails are not set up**, you (or the admin of your instance with access to the database) can reset your password by following the steps outlined in the [self-hosting documentation](/self-hosting/authentication-and-sso).

# I have forgotten my password

## Langfuse Cloud

If you've forgotten your password, you can reset it by following the "Forgot password" link on the login page. This will send you an email with instructions to reset your password.

Please contact us if you encounter any issues: support@langfuse.com

## Self-hosted Langfuse Instance

If transactional emails are configured on your instance, you can reset your password by using the "Forgot password" link on the login page.

If transactional emails are not set up, you (or the admin of your instance with access to the database) can reset your password by following these steps:

1. Update the email associated with your user account in database, such as by adding a prefix.
2. You can then sign up again with a new password.
3. Reassign any projects you were associated with via the members tables in database.
4. Finally, remove the old user account from the `users` table in database.

# I have forgotten my password

## Langfuse Cloud

We can help you recover your account. Unfortunately, there is currently no automated password reset flow.

You will need to send a confirmation email to help@langfuse.com requesting a password reset.

**The process:**

1. Confirm via email to help@langfuse.com that you want to reset your password.
2. We will verify that you can create a new account with this email address.
3. We will then reassign all of your existing projects to the new account you just created.

## Self-hosted Langfuse instance

If you are using a self-hosted Langfuse instance, you can reset your password by following these steps:

1. Update the current email of the user in the `users` table, e.g. by adding a prefix to the email.
2. The user can now sign up again with a new password.
3. Reassign projects via the members tables.
4. Remove the old user from the `users` table.

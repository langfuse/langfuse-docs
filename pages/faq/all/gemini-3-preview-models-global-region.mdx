# Why don't Gemini 3 preview models work in the Playground?

Gemini 3 preview models are only available in the **`global`** region. If your LLM connection is set to another region, model calls from the Playground will fail.

## How to fix it

1. Go to `Project Settings` → `LLM Connections`.
2. Edit (or create) your Google LLM connection.
3. Set the **region** to **`global`** and save.

See [LLM Connections](/docs/administration/llm-connection) for setup details.

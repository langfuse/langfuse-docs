# How to measure prompt performance?

Depending on the scale of your experiments, you can take several approaches:

1. **[Playground](/docs/prompt-management/features/playground)** – ideal for quick, single-prompt experiments directly in the UI.
2. **[Releases and Versioning](/docs/observability/features/releases-and-versioning)** – perform A/B tests and structured experiments in production to compare prompt iterations.
3. **[Datasets](/docs/evaluation/features/datasets)** – benchmark prompts or entire applications offline (or in dev) against a set of reference inputs.

Each of these features integrates tightly with Langfuse’s tracing and evaluation capabilities, allowing you to track metrics, costs, and quality scores over time.

# Langfuse vs. LangSmith

This guide outlines the key differences between **[Langfuse](/)** and **[LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith)** to help engineering teams choose the right LLM observability platform.

**TL;DR:**

* **Choose Langfuse** if you prioritize **Open Source** (MIT), data sovereignty (full self-hosting), a framework-agnostic approach (works with any stack), and transparent unit-based pricing.
* **Choose LangSmith** if you are an **"All-in-LangChain"** shop requiring a managed SaaS solution that offers deep, native integration for deploying LangGraph agents ("DevOps-in-a-box").

## Open Source & Distribution

Langfuse operates on an "Open Core" model where the platform is open source (MIT) and self-hosting is a first-class citizen. LangSmith is a proprietary, closed-source SaaS tool; while it offers a self-hosted option, it is gated strictly behind an Enterprise license.

| Feature | Langfuse | LangSmith |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Model** | **[Open Source](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse)** (MIT License) | **Proprietary SaaS** (Closed Source Backend) |
| **GitHub Stars** | [![Langfuse GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/langfuse/langfuse?style=for-the-badge&label=%20&labelColor=black&color=orange)](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse) | N/A |
| **Self-Hosting** | **First-Class Citizen**: Full feature parity with Cloud. | **Enterprise Only**: Requires a sales contract and license key. |
| **Data Sovereignty** | **High**: Can run fully air-gapped on own VPC without vendor contact. | **Medium**: "Hybrid" deployment available for Enterprise; SaaS defaults to Cloud. |

## Scalability & Performance

Both platforms utilize ClickHouse for high-scale analytics. However, Langfuse's architecture is natively built on ClickHouse (and recently acquired by ClickHouse Inc.), whereas LangSmith abstracts this infrastructure behind a managed SaaS layer.

| Feature | Langfuse | LangSmith |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Backend** | **[ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/)** (Langfuse is part of ClickHouse) | **ClickHouse** |
| **Ingestion** | **Async Queue**: Decoupled Redis queue + generic workers for reliability. | **Queue-Based**: Stateless backend designed for horizontal scaling. |

## Integrations

LangSmith's primary strength is its vertical integration with the LangChain framework. Langfuse positions itself as "Switzerland"—a neutral, framework-agnostic platform built on OpenTelemetry standards.

| Feature | Langfuse | LangSmith |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Standard** | **[OpenTelemetry Native](/docs/observability/overview)**: Architecture built on OTel standards. | **Supported**: Supports OTel ingestion, but features optimize for native SDK. |
| **Frameworks** | Integrations with 80+ frameworks and model providers (OpenAI, Vercel AI SDK, LangChain, etc.) | **Ecosystem Focused**: Deepest support for LangChain/LangGraph; others via OTel. |

## Pricing

The economic models differ significantly. Langfuse charges based on the *depth* of data (Units), while LangSmith charges based on the *volume of root executions* (Traces), largely ignoring internal steps.

| Feature | Langfuse | LangSmith |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Model** | **[Unit-Based](/docs/administration/billable-units)**: 1 Unit = 1 Trace, Observation, or Score. | **Trace-Based**: Charges per root run (internal steps included). |
| **Free Tier** | **50,000 units/mo** (highly generous for developers). | **5,000 traces/mo**. |
| **Plans** | [Free, Core ($29/mo), Pro ($199/mo), Enterprise](/pricing). | [Developer (Free), Plus ($39/seat/mo), Enterprise](https://www.langchain.com/pricing). |

## Open Platform & Extensibility

Langfuse is API-first, allowing teams to treat observability data as their own. LangSmith focuses on extending the LangChain ecosystem via the Hub.

| Feature | Langfuse | LangSmith |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **API Access** | **Full CRUD**: Public API for Traces, Spans, Scores, and Prompts. | **Read/Write**: API available for runs and datasets. |
| **Data Export** | **[Blob Storage Export](/docs/api-and-data-platform/features/export-to-blob-storage)**: Automated dumps to S3/GCP (JSONL/Parquet). | **Bulk Export**: Available on paid plans. |
| **Ecosystem** | **Neutral**: Integrates with any LLM stack or gateway. | **LangChain Hub**: Native integration for prompt sharing. |

## Enterprise Security

Both platforms are enterprise-ready with major certifications. Langfuse offers ISO 27001 in addition to SOC 2, and allows for easier air-gapped compliance via open-source self-hosting.

| Feature | Langfuse | LangSmith |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Certifications** | **[SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001](/security)**, GDPR, HIPAA aligned. | [SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, HIPAA](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/pricing-faq). |
| **Adoption** | Trusted by **19 of Fortune 50** & 63 of Fortune 500. | Wide adoption among LangChain enterprise users. |
| **Governance** | [SSO](/docs/administration/authentication-and-sso), [RBAC](/docs/administration/rbac) available in Teams/Enterprise plans. | SSO, RBAC available in Enterprise plans. |

## Feature Highlights

**Langfuse:**

* **[Model Agnosticism](/docs/integrations/overview):** Works equally well with OpenAI SDK, LiteLLM, LlamaIndex, or raw HTTP calls.
* **[Prompt Management](/docs/prompt-management/overview):** Agnostic playground that doesn't lock you into a specific framework's syntax.
* **[Evaluations](/docs/evaluation/overview):** "LLM-as-a-judge" evaluators that run on your own infrastructure or via the managed service.
* **[ClickHouse Native](/blog/2024-12-langfuse-v3-infrastructure-evolution):** Unrestricted access to raw data via SQL (in self-hosted) for custom analytics.

**LangSmith:**

* **[LangGraph Deployment](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith/deployment):** A specialized runtime to deploy LangGraph agents as APIs (DevOps capabilities).
* **Zero-Setup Tracing:** Automatic instrumentation for LangChain applications via environment variables.
* **[The Hub](https://smith.langchain.com/hub):** Access to a community repository of prompts.

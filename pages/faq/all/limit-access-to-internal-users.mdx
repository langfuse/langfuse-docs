# How can I restrict access on my self-hosted instance to internal users?

If you expose your self-hosted Langfuse instance to the public internet, you may want to restrict access to only internal users.

**Recommended ways to restrict access:**

1. Disable email/password authentication (`AUTH_DISABLE_USERNAME_PASSWORD=true`)
2. Use an authentication provider supported by Langfuse, such as Google, GitHub, Okta, Auth0. See [docs](/docs/deployment/self-host#authentication) for details.
3. Configure your authentication provider to restrict access to only internal users.

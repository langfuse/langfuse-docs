# How do I link prompt management with tracing in Langfuse to see which prompt versions were used?

[Langfuse prompt management](/docs/prompts) makes it easy to collaboratively manage and iterate on prompts. By linking prompt management with tracing, you can see which prompt versions were used to generate specific outputs in your application. This can help you understand how changes to prompts impact the quality of your model's responses and make informed decisions about prompt optimization.

You need to pass the prompt object to the generation logged in Langfuse. [See docs](/docs/prompts/get-started#link-with-langfuse-tracing-optional) for detailed instructions.

# I'm not seeing the latest version of my prompt. Why?

If you've updated a prompt in Langfuse but your application still returns the old version, it's likely due to **caching behavior**. The Langfuse SDKs cache prompts locally to ensure low latency and to keep your application running even if Langfuse would be temporarily unavailable.

For a detailed explanation, see the [prompt caching documentation](/docs/prompt-management/features/caching).

## Solutions

### 1. Wait for cache revalidation

The SDK cache TTL is **60 seconds** by default. After this time, the cached prompt is marked as stale. On the next `get_prompt` call, the stale prompt is returned immediately while the SDK fetches the new version in the background. This means **you need two fetches after the TTL expires** to see the updated prompt.

### 2. Disable caching for development

Set `cacheTtlSeconds` to `0` to always fetch the latest prompt.

> **Note:** Disabling caching adds a network request on every `get_prompt` call, which will increase latency. This is recommended for development/testing only.

```python
prompt = langfuse.get_prompt("my-prompt", cache_ttl_seconds=0)
```

```ts
const prompt = await langfuse.prompt.get("my-prompt", {
  cacheTtlSeconds: 0,
});
```

### 3. Verify the correct label

By default, `get_prompt` fetches the `production` label. If you haven't promoted your changes to production, use `label="latest"` to fetch the most recent version:

<LangTabs items={["Python SDK", "JS/TS SDK"]}>
<Tab>

```python
prompt = langfuse.get_prompt("my-prompt", label="latest")
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts
const prompt = await langfuse.prompt.get("my-prompt", {
  label: "latest",
});
```

</Tab>
</LangTabs>

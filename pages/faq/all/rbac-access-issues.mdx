# Why can't users access expected features or data?

If users in your Langfuse organization can't access features, projects, or data they should be able to see, this is typically related to Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions.

## Understanding Langfuse RBAC

Langfuse uses a hierarchical permission system:
- **Organization-level roles**: Control access to organization settings and features
- **Project-level roles**: Control access to specific projects and their data
- **Custom roles**: Allow fine-grained permission control

## Common access issues and solutions

### 1. User can't see specific projects

**Symptoms**: User is logged in but doesn't see expected projects in the project list.

**Solutions**:
- **Check project membership**: Go to Project Settings → Members and verify the user is added
- **Add user to project**: Click "Add Member" and invite the user with appropriate role
- **Verify role permissions**: Ensure the assigned role has project access permissions
- **Check organization membership**: User must be an organization member first

### 2. User can't see traces or observations

**Symptoms**: User can access the project but sees no data or limited data.

**Solutions**:
- **Check project role**: Ensure user has at least "Viewer" role for the project
- **Verify environment access**: Check if the user has access to the specific environment
- **Review data filters**: User might have filters applied that hide the data
- **Check date range**: Ensure the selected date range includes the expected data

### 3. User can't access organization settings

**Symptoms**: User doesn't see organization settings or admin features.

**Solutions**:
- **Check organization role**: User needs "Admin" or "Owner" role for organization settings
- **Verify permissions**: Review what the current role allows in the RBAC documentation
- **Update role**: Assign appropriate organization-level role if needed

### 4. User can't create or modify resources

**Symptoms**: User can view data but can't create projects, invite users, or modify settings.

**Solutions**:
- **Check write permissions**: Ensure the role includes necessary write permissions
- **Review role hierarchy**: Some actions require higher-level roles
- **Verify project-specific permissions**: Some actions are project-scoped
- **Check organization policies**: Some organizations restrict certain actions

### 5. Custom role not working as expected

**Symptoms**: Users with custom roles can't access features that should be permitted.

**Solutions**:
- **Review custom role configuration**: Check all permission settings in the role
- **Verify role assignment**: Ensure the custom role is properly assigned to the user
- **Check permission inheritance**: Understand how permissions combine across roles
- **Test with standard role**: Temporarily assign a standard role to isolate the issue

## Troubleshooting steps

### For administrators:

1. **Audit user permissions**:
   ```
   Organization Settings → Members → [User] → View Roles
   Project Settings → Members → [User] → Check Role
   ```

2. **Review role definitions**:
   - Check what permissions each role includes
   - Verify custom roles have necessary permissions
   - Compare with working user accounts

3. **Test access systematically**:
   - Log in as the affected user (if possible)
   - Test each feature that should be accessible
   - Document what works vs. what doesn't

### For users experiencing issues:

1. **Check your current roles**:
   - Go to your profile settings
   - Review organization and project memberships
   - Note your assigned roles

2. **Clear browser cache**:
   - Clear cookies and cache for Langfuse
   - Try in an incognito/private window
   - Refresh the page after clearing cache

3. **Verify you're in the right context**:
   - Check you're viewing the correct organization
   - Ensure you've selected the right project
   - Verify the correct environment is selected

## Common permission patterns

### Minimum roles for common tasks:

- **View traces and data**: Project Viewer
- **Create annotations and scores**: Project Editor  
- **Invite project members**: Project Admin
- **Manage organization settings**: Organization Admin
- **Create new projects**: Organization Member (with project creation permissions)

### Role hierarchy:
- Organization Owner > Organization Admin > Organization Member
- Project Admin > Project Editor > Project Viewer

## Environment-specific access

If your organization uses multiple environments (dev, staging, prod):

1. **Check environment permissions**: Users might have access to some environments but not others
2. **Verify environment selection**: Ensure the user is viewing the correct environment
3. **Review environment-specific roles**: Some organizations have environment-scoped permissions

## API key permissions

If issues involve API access:

1. **Check API key scope**: API keys inherit permissions from the user who created them
2. **Verify key expiration**: Ensure API keys haven't expired
3. **Review key permissions**: API keys might have more restrictive permissions than user accounts

## When to contact support

Contact support if:
- Permission issues persist after checking roles and assignments
- Custom roles aren't working as configured
- Users are missing from organization or project member lists
- You need help designing a complex RBAC structure

Include this information:
- Affected user email addresses
- Specific features or data they can't access
- Current role assignments (organization and project level)
- Screenshots of error messages or missing features
- Steps already attempted to resolve the issue

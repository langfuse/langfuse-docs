# Self-Hosting Langfuse

## Overview

Langfuse is an open source project. The core of Langfuse is MIT-licensed and can easily be [self-hosted](/self-hosting).

The self-hosted version of Langfuse is also available as an Enterprise Edition (EE) which is paid and includes access to certain commercially-licensed features and services that require a [license key](/self-hosting/license-key) ([get trial key](/request-trial)).

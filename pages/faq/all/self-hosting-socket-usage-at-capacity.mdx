# Socket usage at capacity error in self-hosted Langfuse

If you are experiencing socket usage at capacity errors, it indicates that the Langfuse Web container is not able to open new connections.
You can either increase the number of langfuse-web containers handling requests or increase the number of available sockets.
To achieve the latter, set `LANGFUSE_S3_CONCURRENT_WRITES` to a value greater than `50`.
Note that an increased number of sockets may increase the memory consumption of your container.

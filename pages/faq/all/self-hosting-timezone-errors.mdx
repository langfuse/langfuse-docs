# Timezone errors in self-hosted Langfuse

Langfuse is engineered to run in the UTC timezone and expects that all infrastructure components default to UTC.
Especially Postgres and ClickHouse settings that overwrite the UTC default are not supported and may lead to unexpected behavior.
If you would like us to consider supporting other timezones, please vote on this [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/5046).

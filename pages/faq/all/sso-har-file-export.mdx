# How to export HAR file for SSO troubleshooting

When experiencing Single Sign-On (SSO) issues in Langfuse, support teams often need detailed network information to diagnose the problem. A HAR (HTTP Archive) file captures all HTTP requests and responses, providing valuable insights into authentication flows.

## What is a HAR file?

A HAR file is a JSON-formatted archive that logs all HTTP requests made by your browser, including:
- Request and response headers
- Cookies and session data
- Timing information
- Response content
- Error details

## When to generate a HAR file

Generate a HAR file when experiencing:
- SSO login failures or redirects not working
- Authentication tokens not being properly exchanged
- Unexpected errors during the login process
- Slow or hanging authentication requests

## Browser-specific instructions

### Google Chrome

1. **Open Developer Tools**: Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
2. **Access Network Tab**: Click on the "Network" tab
3. **Configure settings**: 
   - Ensure the red record button is active
   - Check "Preserve log" to keep logs during navigation
4. **Clear existing logs**: Click the clear button (üö´)
5. **Reproduce the issue**: Refresh the page and perform the SSO steps that cause problems
6. **Export**: Right-click in the network log and select "Save all as HAR with content"

> **Chrome 130+**: For sensitive data, go to Developer Tools settings ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Check "Allow to generate HAR with sensitive data", then long-press download and select "Export HAR (with sensitive data)"

### Mozilla Firefox

2. **Access Network Tab**: Click on the "Network" tab

5. **Export**: Right-click in the network requests and select "Save All As HAR"

### Microsoft Edge

1. **Open Developer Tools**: Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`
2. **Access Network Tab**: Click on the "Network" tab

## Security considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: HAR files contain sensitive information including authentication tokens, session cookies, and personal data.

**Before sharing**:
- Review the HAR file contents in a text editor
- Remove or redact sensitive values (replace with `[REDACTED]`)
- Pay attention to Authorization headers and cookie values
- Use secure, encrypted channels for sharing
- Delete the file after the issue is resolved

## What to include with your HAR file

When submitting to support, include:
- **Detailed description** of what you were trying to do
- **Expected vs. actual behavior**
- **Browser type and version**
- **Timestamp** of when the issue occurred
- **User account** that experienced the issue
- **Environment** (production, staging, etc.)

## Alternative tools

If browser Developer Tools aren't suitable:
- **Fiddler**: HTTP debugging proxy
- **Charles Proxy**: HTTP monitoring tool
- **Postman**: For direct API testing
- **curl**: Command-line HTTP requests

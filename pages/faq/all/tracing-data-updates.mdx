# How to update traces, observations, and scores?

This guide covers how to update traces, observations, and scores in Langfuse, highlighting differences between available update methods.

## What can I update?

Langfuse is moving to a mostly immutable data model for observability data (traces and observations in the Langfuse [data model](/docs/observability/data-model)).

If you want to enrich traces or observations after they were ingested with evaluations/annotations, please look into scores ([docs](docs/evaluation/evaluation-methods/custom-scores)) that can be added to traces, observations, sessions, and dataset runs at any time.

## Updating Traces and Observations

**Via the Langfuse UI**

UI-based updates ([tags](/docs/observability/features/tags), bookmarks, [publishing](/docs/observability/features/url.mdx)) can be made at any time

**Via SDK or Ingestion API**

- You can upsert traces and observations based on their `id`
- Within 60 days of creation, updates will replace the existing trace or observation.
- After 60 days, updates create duplicate entries containing only the changed fields. This can lead to inconsistencies in dashboards and historical filtering.

## Updating Scores

Scores can be updated at any time. You can upsert scores based on their `id` ([docs](/docs/evaluation/evaluation-methods/custom-scores#update)).

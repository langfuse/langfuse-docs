<Callout type="info">
  Langfuse is moving to a mostly immutable data model. If you want to enrich traces or observations after they were ingested, please look into scores ([docs](docs/evaluation/evaluation-methods/custom-scores)). If you want to connect multiple traces, please look into sessions ([docs](docs/observability/features/sessions)).

# How do I update traces, observations, and scores?

This guide covers how to update traces, observations, and scores in Langfuse, highlighting differences between available update methods.

### Update Methods

**Via the Langfuse UI**
- UI-based updates (tags, bookmarks, publishing) can be made at any time and will produce expected results.
- No time restrictions apply.

**Via SDK or Ingestion API**
- Updates are only accepted within **60 days** of creation.
- **After 60 days:** Updates create duplicate entries containing only the changed fields.
- Duplicates may cause inconsistencies in dashboards and historical filtering.


### Langfuse Cloud vs. Self-Hosted

The above mentioned behavior only applies to Langfuse Cloud. In self-hosted environments, the blob storage for raw events of scores, traces, and observations is never expired. With that, Langfuse is able to process updates indefinitely.

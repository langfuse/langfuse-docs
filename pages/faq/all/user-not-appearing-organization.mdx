# Why aren't invited users appearing in my organization?

If you've invited users to your Langfuse organization but they're not appearing or can't access resources, here are the most common causes and solutions.

## Common causes and solutions

### 1. User hasn't accepted the invitation

**Check**: Ask the user to check their email inbox (including spam folder) for the invitation email.

**Solution**: 
- Resend the invitation from the organization settings
- Ensure the invitation was sent to the correct email address
- Ask the user to check all email folders, including spam/junk

### 2. User is logging in with a different email

**Check**: Verify the user is logging in with the exact same email address that received the invitation.

**Solution**:
- Confirm the email address used for the invitation matches their login credentials
- If using SSO, ensure the SSO provider returns the same email address
- Re-invite using the correct email address if needed

### 3. Email domain mismatch in SSO configuration

**Check**: If using SSO, verify that the user's email domain is properly configured in your SSO settings.

**Solution**:
- Review your SSO domain mapping configuration
- Ensure the user's email domain is included in allowed domains
- Check that attribute mapping is correctly configured in your identity provider

### 4. Role assignment issues

**Check**: Verify that the invited user has been assigned appropriate roles.

**Solution**:
- Go to Organization Settings â†’ Members
- Check the user's role assignments
- Assign the necessary roles for accessing specific projects or features
- Review RBAC permissions if using custom roles

### 5. Organization membership not synced

**Check**: Sometimes there can be delays in membership synchronization.

**Solution**:
- Ask the user to log out and log back in
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Wait a few minutes and refresh the page
- Check if the user appears in the organization member list

### 6. SSO configuration issues

**Check**: If using SSO, there might be configuration problems with your identity provider.

**Solution**:
- Verify SSO configuration in Langfuse matches your identity provider settings
- Check that user attributes are being passed correctly
- Review SSO logs for any error messages
- Generate a [HAR file](/faq/all/sso-har-file-export) if login issues persist

### 7. User account exists in different region

**Check**: Ensure the user is accessing the correct Langfuse region (EU/US).

**Solution**:
- Confirm which region your organization is hosted in
- Direct the user to the correct Langfuse URL for your region
- If needed, create a new invitation for the correct region

## Additional troubleshooting steps

### For organization administrators:

1. **Check organization member list**:
   - Go to Organization Settings
   - Review the complete member list
   - Look for pending invitations

2. **Review invitation status**:
   - Check if invitations are marked as "Pending" or "Accepted"
   - Resend expired invitations

3. **Verify permissions**:
   - Ensure you have admin permissions to invite users
   - Check organization-level settings for user invitation policies

### For invited users:

1. **Clear browser data**:
   - Clear cookies and cache for Langfuse
   - Try accessing in an incognito/private browser window

2. **Check account status**:
   - Ensure your Langfuse account is fully activated
   - Complete any required account verification steps

3. **Try different browser**:
   - Test with a different browser or device
   - Disable browser extensions that might interfere

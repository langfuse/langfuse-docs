# Can I use Jinja, Liquid, or other templating libraries with Langfuse prompts?

Yes! While Langfuse has its own [variable syntax](/docs/prompt-management/features/variables) (`{{variable}}`) with the `compile()` method, you can use external templating libraries like Jinja2 or Liquid instead for advanced features like conditionals, loops, and filters.

**Do you need external templating libraries?** Managing external templating languages in a prompt editor can be cumbersome. You might be able to do this in a simpler way using [Langfuse variables](/faq/all/conditional-prompt-embedding) instead.


## How it works

Langfuse prompts return plain strings (text prompts) or arrays of message objects (chat prompts). If you want to use an external templating library, store your Jinja2/Liquid template as-is in Langfuse and apply your templating library client-side:

1. Store your Jinja2/Liquid template in Langfuse (don't use Langfuse's `{{variable}}` syntax)
2. Fetch the prompt from Langfuse using `get_prompt()`
3. Access the raw prompt string via `prompt.prompt`
4. Apply your templating library (Jinja2, Liquid, etc.) to render the final prompt
5. Pass the result to your LLM

## Limitations

When using external templating libraries instead of Langfuse's native variable syntax:

- **Playground:** The Langfuse [Playground](/docs/prompt-management/features/playground) only supports automatic rendering with Langfuse's native variable syntax. Prompts with Jinja2/Liquid syntax won't be automatically testable directly from Prompt Management. However, you can still jump from traces (which contain the compiled prompt) to the Playground.
- **Prompt experiments:** You cannot use in-UI prompt experiments since they rely on Langfuse's `compile()`. You can use [Experiments via the SDK](/docs/evaluation/experiments/experiments-via-sdk) where you compile the prompt yourself as part of the task.
- **Variable detection:** Langfuse's UI will only detect variables using the `{{variable}}` syntax. Jinja2/Liquid variables won't appear in the variable list.

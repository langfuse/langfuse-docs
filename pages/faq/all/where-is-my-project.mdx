# I cannot find my project?

## Are you on the correct Langfuse tenant? (EU/US?)

We run Langfuse in two data regions. In the [European Union](https://cloud.langfuse.com) and the [US](https://us.cloud.langfuse.com).
Make sure that you are logged into the data region that you have created your project in. You can select the data region during log-in. You can also see it in the URL bar (cloud.langfuse.com = EU and us.cloud.langfuse.com = USA)

Find out more about [Langfuse Cloud Data Regions](/security/data-regions).

## Are you using the correct email address?

If you have been invited to a project, make sure you are logging in with the exact email address that this invite has gone out to. If you log in with SSO (e.g. GitHub or Google), your email address might be different from what you expected.

If you click your name in the bottom left of the Langfuse UI, you will see the email address we have on record for you.

## Are you the project owner?

If someone else in your organization created the project, ask them to re-invite you and/or send you the link to the project you are looking for.

## Still cannot find your project?

Reach out to us via support@langfuse.com and add as much detail (e.g. project name, ID, email associated with it, workers on the project etc) as possible.

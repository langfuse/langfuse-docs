# LLM Application Intent Classification

This notebook will help you build a basic intent classification pipeline to automate the labeling and analysis of trace data from your Langfuse projects.

Why is this useful?

- LLM applications often contain a number of mixed intents
- Breaking down evaluations by intent helps to identify which groups of traces perform badly in production
- Measuring the volume/intent is necessary to make sure that datasets used for offline/development evaluation are representative of production usage

You can approach intent classification in two ways:
- **Supervised approach**: You provide a model with labeled training data, and the model will output one of the pre-defined labels when making predictions.
- **Unsupervised approach**: The model attempts to find clusters within the data, which you can then label appropriately.

---

By the end of this notebook, you'll have two basic pipelines that will:

1. Extract trace data from one of your Langfuse projects.
2. Train an intent classification model.
3. Predict the intent of traces using both supervised and unsupervised approaches.
4. Upload predicted intent results back to Langfuse as [tags](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing-features/tags).

## Supervised intent classification pipeline (dummy data)

This section outlines the process of creating a supervised intent classification model with Langfuse trace data. The steps include retrieving trace data, using scikit-learn and sentence transformers to build and train the model, predicting intents, and tagging traces with labels in Langfuse. This method requires labeled data but ensures consistent predictions for predefined intents, ideal for clearly defined intent identification.

### 1. Retrieve Langfuse traces


```python
from langfuse import Langfuse
langfuse = Langfuse()
```

#### Optional: Create dummy trace data
If your project is empty, you can run the next two cells to create some simple dummy trace data to use for this notebook.  The remainder of this section expects a trace with a "message" key in the input.  You may need to adjust the notebook to your trace data's structure if you use data with another structure.


```python
sample_utterances = [
    "Hello again",
    "Can you do anything else?",
    "Could you recommend a good book?",
    "I'd like to watch a drama",
    "Please revert to the beginning"
]

# Create dummy traces
for utterance in sample_utterances:
    langfuse.trace(input={"message": utterance})
```

#### Fetch data from your project


```python
traces = langfuse.fetch_traces()
traces.data[0].dict()
```

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

```


```python
# Note: This is a very small dataset.

```python
df = pd.DataFrame(sample_data)
df.head()
```


```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    df["text"],
    df["intent"],
    test_size=0.5,

)
```


```python
class Encoder(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    def __init__(self):
        self.embedding_model = embedding_model

    def transform(self, X):
        return self.embedding_model.encode(list(X))

### 3. Run predictions on traces


```python
for index, row in traces_df.iterrows():
    result = pipeline.predict([row["message"]])
    probas = pipeline.predict_proba([row["message"]])
    confidence_score = float(np.max(probas, axis=1)[0])

    traces_df.at[index, "label"] = "".join(result)
    traces_df.at[index, "confidence_score"] = confidence_score

traces_df
```

### 4. Tag traces with labels


```python
# Note: This will add to existing tags, not add duplicate tags.
for index, row in traces_df.iterrows():
    if row["confidence_score"] > 0.30:
        trace_id = row["trace_id"]
        label = row["label"]
        langfuse.trace(id=trace_id, tags = [label])
```

## Unsupervised intent classification pipeline (production data)

The unsupervised intent classification pipeline demonstrates how to cluster and label Langfuse trace data without predefined categories. It uses embedding techniques, clustering algorithms, and LLM-generated labels to automatically identify and tag intents, offering flexibility for unlabeled data but potentially less consistency than supervised methods.

We will use sample data from the [public demo](https://langfuse.com/demo) project (RAG on Langfuse Documentation) to understand what people are most interested in when interacting with the demo application.


```python
import os

# Get keys for your project from the project settings page
# https://cloud.langfuse.com
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = ""
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = ""
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ US region

# Your openai key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""
```


```python
langfuse = Langfuse()
```

### 1. Fetch traces from Langfuse

We will fetch 15,000 messages sent to the demo application in order to create meaningful clusters.


```python
PAGES_TO_FETCH = 300

traces = []
for i in range(PAGES_TO_FETCH):
    traces_page = langfuse.fetch_traces(page=i+1)
    traces.extend(traces_page.data)
```


```python
traces_list = []
for trace in traces:
    trace_info = [trace.id, trace.input]
    traces_list.append(trace_info)
```


```python
import pandas as pd

cluster_traces_df = pd.DataFrame(traces_list, columns=["trace_id", "message"])
cluster_traces_df.dropna(inplace=True) # drop traces with message = None
```

### 2. Embed messages


```python
# naive implementation (batch=1)
# cluster_traces_df["embeddings"] = cluster_traces_df["message"].map(embedding_model.encode)

# use batches to speed up embedding
from tqdm import tqdm

batch_size = 512  # Choose an appropriate batch size based on your model and hardware capabilities
messages = cluster_traces_df["message"].tolist()
embeddings = []

# Use tqdm to wrap your range function for the progress bar
for i in tqdm(range(0, len(messages), batch_size), desc="Encoding batches"):
    batch = messages[i:i + batch_size]
    batch_embeddings = embedding_model.encode(batch)
    embeddings.extend(batch_embeddings)

cluster_traces_df["embeddings"] = embeddings
```

    Encoding batches: 100%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ| 30/30 [00:32<00:00,  1.09s/it]


### 3. Create clusters based on embeddings


```python
import hdbscan
clusterer = hdbscan.HDBSCAN(min_cluster_size=10)
cluster_traces_df["cluster"] = clusterer.fit_predict(cluster_traces_df["embeddings"].to_list())
```


```python
cluster_traces_df["cluster"].value_counts().head(10).to_dict()
```




    {-1: 9005,
     0: 544,
     83: 438,
     92: 396,
     3: 298,
     86: 215,
     1: 155,
     94: 147,
     58: 146,
     77: 133}



### 4. Derive cluster labels


```python
import openai

# Note: Depending on the volume of data you are running,
# you may want to limit the number of utterances representing each group (ex. utterances_group[:5])

def generate_label(message_group):
    prompt = f"""
        # Task
        Your goal is to assign an intent label that most accurately fits the given group of utterances.
        You will only provide a single label, no explanation.  The label should be snake cased.

        ## Example utterances
        so long
        bye

        ## Example labels
        goodbye
        end_conversation

        Utterances: {message_group}
        Label:
    """
    response = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": prompt
            }
        ],
        max_tokens=50
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()

for cluster in cluster_traces_df["cluster"].unique():
    if cluster == -1:
        continue
    messages_in_cluster = cluster_traces_df[cluster_traces_df["cluster"] == cluster]["message"]

    # sample if too many messages
    if len(messages_in_cluster) > 50:
        messages_in_cluster = messages_in_cluster.sample(50)

    label = generate_label(messages_in_cluster)
    cluster_traces_df.loc[cluster_traces_df["cluster"] == cluster, "cluster_label"] = label
```

### 5. Inspect the clusters


```python
cluster_traces_df["cluster_label"].value_counts().head(20).to_dict()
```

### 6. Add clusters as tags back to Langfuse


```python
# add as labels back to langfuse
for index, row in cluster_traces_df.iterrows():
    if row["cluster"] != -1:
        trace_id = row["trace_id"]
        label = row["cluster_label"]
        langfuse.trace(id=trace_id, tags=[label])
```

## Conclusion

Each approach has its pros and cons.  

The supervised approach requires a lot of effort upfront to prepare a labelled dataset of an appropriate size.  During inference, it will only be able to assign labels that it was trained on, so it will not handle new cases well.  However, the inference will be consistent.

The unsupervised approach offers more flexibility in working with unlabeled data.  It can output a variety of new labels you didn't define beforehand.  However, the labels may not be consistent between runs (ex., 'hello', 'greeting', or 'start_conversation').  Additionally, the clusters may be more or less permissive than if you had labelled the data.

Combining both approaches may be ideal.  Unsupervised intent classification can help you quickly get an overview of a large volume of data, helping you with initial exploratory analysis.  As you understand your trace data better and get more samples, you may benefit from running the supervised model on your data using the intent labels you most care about.  Or, you may want to use the embedded data stored in the vector database to run similarity searches and reuse the labels from previous runs on new instances!

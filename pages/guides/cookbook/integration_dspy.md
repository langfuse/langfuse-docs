# DSPy - Observability & Tracing

This cookbook demonstrates how to use [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) with Langfuse. DSPy is a framework that systematically optimizes language model prompts and weights, making it easier to build and refine complex systems with LMs by automating the tuning process and improving reliability. For further information on DSPy, please visit the [documentation](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/docs/intro).

Langfuse can help with running DSPy projects by providing a centralized observability platform for debugging and monitoring.

**Note**: This is a community contributed integration ([initial PR](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/pull/1186) by [@xucailiang](https://github.com/xucailiang)). DSPy documentation can be found [here](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/intro/). If you encounter issues or want to contribute to the integration, please open an issue or PR.

In this Example Notebook, we will:

- Use OpenAI models as they are automatically instrumented by Langfuse when used within DSPy.
- Use Mistral models as an example for how to trace any model via a custom tracker.
- Run a RAG Example.

## Setup


```python
!pip install mistralai langfuse
```

Install latest dspy from main to get the latest features.


```python
!pip install git+https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy.git
```

---

If you run this in a Jupyter Notebook, you may need to restart the session at this point; otherwise, the imports might not work correctly.

---


```python
import os

# Get keys for your project from the project settings page
# https://cloud.langfuse.com
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = ""
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = ""
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ US region

# Your openai key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""

# Your mistral key
os.environ["MISTRAL_API_KEY"] = ""
```

Note: When executing the same prompt multiple times, DSPy utilizes a caching mechanism that returns the cached response for identical prompts. As a result, no new trace will be logged to Langfuse for repeated prompts.

## Examples

### Simple Chat with OpenAI (automated tracing)

This example demonstrates how to use DSPy with the Langfuse to query a language model. We set up the `LangfuseTracker` to monitor interactions, configure the GPT-4 model with specific parameters, and then use it to generate an answer based on the questions.


```python
import dspy
from dsp.trackers.langfuse_tracker import LangfuseTracker

langfuse = LangfuseTracker()
openai = dspy.OpenAI(model='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, max_tokens=1500)

openai("Explain DSPy and Langfuse to me")
```

## Simple Chat with Mistral (custom dspy tracker)

For non-OpenAI models, we can add a custom tracker to add traces in Langfuse.


```python
mistral = dspy.Mistral(
    model='mistral-medium-latest',
    api_key=os.getenv("MISTRAL_API_KEY")
)

completions = mistral("Hi, what do you like about DSPy?")

mistral.tracker_call(tracker=langfuse)

class CustomTracker(LangfuseTracker):

    def call(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Call the super class method if needed
        super().call(**kwargs)

        # Unpack args if they are being used to pass i, o, etc.
        i = kwargs.get('i')
        o = kwargs.get('o')
        name = kwargs.get('name')
        o_content = o.choices[0].message.content if o else None

        # Log trace to Langfuse via low-level SDK
        trace = self.langfuse.trace(
            name="dspy-mistral",
            input=i,
            output=o_content
        )
        trace.generation(
            input=i,
            output=o_content,
            name=name,
            metadata=kwargs,
            usage=o.usage,
            model=o.model
        )

custom_langfuse_tracker = CustomTracker()

mistral.tracker_call(tracker=custom_langfuse_tracker)
```

## RAG Example

We'll configure DSPy to use GPT-4o-mini from the previous example as the language model (LM) and ColBERTv2 as the retrieval model (RM). This setup allows DSPy to dynamically call these models during the generation and retrieval processes.


```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from dspy.functional import TypedPredictor
from dspy.teleprompt import LabeledFewShot

colbertv2_wiki17_abstracts = dspy.ColBERTv2(url='http://20.102.90.50:2017/wiki17_abstracts')
dspy.settings.configure(lm=openai, rm=colbertv2_wiki17_abstracts)
```

We'll use the HotPotQA dataset, which features complex question-answer pairs ideal for multi-hop reasoning.


```python
from dspy.datasets import HotPotQA

# Load the dataset.
dataset = HotPotQA(train_seed=1, train_size=10, eval_seed=2023, dev_size=25, test_size=0)

# Tell DSPy that the 'question' field is the input. Any other fields are labels and/or metadata.
trainset = [x.with_inputs('question') for x in dataset.train]
devset = [x.with_inputs('question') for x in dataset.dev]

len(trainset), len(devset)
```


Define the input-output signatures, specifying how the model should use the retrieved context to generate answers.


```python
class GenerateAnswer(dspy.Signature):
    """Answer questions with short factoid answers."""

    context = dspy.InputField(desc="may contain relevant facts")
    question = dspy.InputField()
    answer = dspy.OutputField(desc="often between 1 and 5 words")

```

Create the RAG pipeline, utilizing DSPy modules for retrieval and answer generation.


```python
class RAG(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_passages=3):
        super().__init__()

        self.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=num_passages)
        self.generate_answer = dspy.ChainOfThought(GenerateAnswer)

    def forward(self, question):
        context = self.retrieve(question).passages
        prediction = self.generate_answer(context=context, question=question)
        return dspy.Prediction(context=context, answer=prediction.answer)
```

Compile the RAG program, leveraging DSPy's teleprompters to optimize prompt selection based on validation metrics.


```python
from dspy.teleprompt import BootstrapFewShot

# Validation logic: check that the predicted answer is correct.
# Also check that the retrieved context does actually contain that answer.
def validate_context_and_answer(example, pred, trace=None):
    answer_EM = dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match(example, pred)
    answer_PM = dspy.evaluate.answer_passage_match(example, pred)
    return answer_EM and answer_PM

# Set up a basic teleprompter, which will compile our RAG program.
teleprompter = BootstrapFewShot(metric=validate_context_and_answer)

# Compile!
compiled_rag = teleprompter.compile(RAG(), trainset=trainset)
```

Example compilation trace: https://cloud.langfuse.com/project/cloramnkj0002jz088vzn1ja4/traces/25d21f68-4908-4b81-8616-710b16cd8e84



Run the compiled RAG pipeline to retrieve answers based on your queries.


```python
# Ask any question you like to this simple RAG program.
my_question = "Who conducts the draft in which Marc-Andre Fleury was drafted to the Vegas Golden Knights for the 2017-18 season????????"

# Get the prediction. This contains `pred.context` and `pred.answer`.
pred = compiled_rag(my_question)

# Print the contexts and the answer.
print(f"Question: {my_question}")
print(f"Predicted Answer: {pred.answer}")
print(f"Retrieved Contexts (truncated): {[c[:200] + '...' for c in pred.context]}")
```

    Question: Who conducts the draft in which Marc-Andre Fleury was drafted to the Vegas Golden Knights for the 2017-18 season????????
    Predicted Answer: National Hockey League
    Retrieved Contexts (truncated): ['2017â€“18 Pittsburgh Penguins season | The 2017â€“18 Pittsburgh Penguins season will be the 51st season for the National Hockey League ice hockey team that was established on June 5, 1967. They will enter...', 'Marc-AndrÃ© Fleury | Marc-AndrÃ© Fleury (born November 28, 1984) is a French-Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender playing for the Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League (NHL).

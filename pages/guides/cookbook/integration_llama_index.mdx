# Integrate Langfuse with LlamaIndex

This notebook provides a step-by-step guide on integrating **Langfuse** with **LlamaIndex** to achieve observability and debugging for your LLM applications.

> **What is LlamaIndex?** [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index)) is an advanced "data framework" tailored for augmenting LLMs with private data. It streamlines the integration of diverse data sources and formats (APIs, PDFs, docs, SQL, etc.) through versatile data connectors and structures data into indices and graphs for LLM compatibility. The platform offers a sophisticated retrieval/query interface for enriching LLM inputs with context-specific outputs.

> **What is Langfuse?** [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is an open-source LLM engineering platform. It offers tracing and monitoring capabilities for AI applications. Langfuse helps developers debug, analyze, and optimize their AI systems by providing detailed insights and integrating with a wide array of tools and frameworks through native integrations, OpenTelemetry, and dedicated SDKs.

## Getting Started

Let's walk through a practical example of using LlamaIndex and integrating it with Langfuse for comprehensive tracing.

<Steps>
### Step 1: Install Dependencies

<Callout type="info" emoji="⚠️">
_**Note:** This notebook utilizes the Langfuse OTel Python SDK v3.
</Callout>



```python
%pip install langfuse openinference-instrumentation-llama-index llama-index-llms-openai llama-index -U
```

### Step 2: Configure Langfuse SDK

Next, set up your Langfuse API keys. You can get these keys by signing up for a free [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com/) account or by [self-hosting Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting). These environment variables are essential for the Langfuse client to authenticate and send data to your Langfuse project.



```python
import os

# Get keys for your project from the project settings page: https://cloud.langfuse.com

os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇪🇺 EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇺🇸 US region

# Your OpenAI key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-proj-..."

```

With the environment variables set, we can now initialize the Langfuse client. `get_client()` initializes the Langfuse client using the credentials provided in the environment variables.



```python
from langfuse import get_client
 
langfuse = get_client()
 
# Verify connection
if langfuse.auth_check():
    print("Langfuse client is authenticated and ready!")
else:
    print("Authentication failed. Please check your credentials and host.")

```

### Step 3: Initialize LlamaIndex Instrumentation

Now, we initialize the [OpenInference LlamaIndex instrumentation](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/tracing/integrations-tracing/llamaindex). This third-party instrumentation automatically captures LlamaIndex operations and exports OpenTelemetry (OTel) spans to Langfuse.


```python
from openinference.instrumentation.llama_index import LlamaIndexInstrumentor

# Initialize LlamaIndex instrumentation
LlamaIndexInstrumentor().instrument()
```

### Step 4: Basic LlamaIndex Application

Let's create a straightforward LlamaIndex application. In this example, we'll create a simple query engine that can answer questions. This will serve as the foundation for demonstrating Langfuse tracing.



```python
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
 
with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="llama-index-trace"):
    response = llm.complete("Hello, world!")
    print(response)
 
langfuse.flush()
```

### Step 5: View Traces in Langfuse

After executing the application, navigate to your Langfuse Trace Table. You will find detailed traces of the application's execution, providing insights into the LLM calls, retrieval operations, inputs, outputs, and performance metrics. The trace will show the complete flow from query processing through document retrieval to response generation.

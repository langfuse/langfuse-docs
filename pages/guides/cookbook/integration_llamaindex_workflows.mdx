# Observability for LlamaIndex Workflows

This cookbook demonstrates how to use [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) to gain real-time observability for your [LlamaIndex Workflows](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/workflow/).

> **What are LlamaIndex Workflows?** [LlamaIndex Workflows](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/workflow/) is a flexible, event-driven framework designed to build robust AI agents. In LlamaIndex, workflows are created by chaining together multiple steps—each defined and validated using the `@step` decorator. Every step processes specific event types, allowing you to orchestrate complex processes such as AI agent collaboration, RAG flows, data extraction, and more.

> **What is Langfuse?** [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is the open source LLM engineering platform. It helps teams to collaboratively manage prompts, trace applications, debug problems, and evaluate their LLM system in production.

## Get Started

We'll walk through a simple example of using LlamaIndex Workflows and integrating it with Langfuse.

<Steps>
### Step 1: Install Dependencies

<Callout type="info" emoji="⚠️">
_**Note:** This notebook utilizes the Langfuse OTel Python SDK v3. For users of Python SDK v2, please refer to our [legacy LlamaIndex integration guide](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/llama-index/deprecated/get-started)._
</Callout>


```python
%pip install langfuse openai llama-index
```

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

Configure your Langfuse API keys. You can get them by signing up for [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com) or [self-hosting Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting).


```python
import os

# Get keys for your project from the project settings page: https://cloud.langfuse.com
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇪🇺 EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇺🇸 US region

# Set your OpenAI API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-proj-..."
```

With the environment variables set, we can now initialize the Langfuse client. `get_client()` initializes the Langfuse client using the credentials provided in the environment variables.


```python
from langfuse import get_client
 
langfuse = get_client()
 
# Verify connection
if langfuse.auth_check():
    print("Langfuse client is authenticated and ready!")
else:
    print("Authentication failed. Please check your credentials and host.")

```

### Step 3: Initialize LlamaIndex Instrumentation

Now, we initialize the [OpenInference LlamaIndex instrumentation](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/tracing/integrations-tracing/llamaindex). This third-party instrumentation automatically captures LlamaIndex operations and exports OpenTelemetry (OTel) spans to Langfuse.


```python
from openinference.instrumentation.llama_index import LlamaIndexInstrumentor

# Initialize LlamaIndex instrumentation
LlamaIndexInstrumentor().instrument()
```

### Step 4: Create a Simple LlamaIndex Workflows Application

In LlamaIndex Workflows, you build event-driven AI agents by defining steps with the `@step` decorator. Each step processes an event and, if appropriate, emits new events. In this example, we create a simple workflow with two steps: one that pre-processes an incoming event and another that generates a reply.


```python
from llama_index.core.workflow import (
    Event,
    StartEvent,
    StopEvent,
    Workflow,
    step,
)

# `pip install llama-index-llms-openai` if you don't already have it
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI

class JokeEvent(Event):
    joke: str

class JokeFlow(Workflow):
    llm = OpenAI()

    @step
    async def generate_joke(self, ev: StartEvent) -> JokeEvent:
        topic = ev.topic

        prompt = f"Write your best joke about {topic}."
        response = await self.llm.acomplete(prompt)
        return JokeEvent(joke=str(response))

    @step
    async def critique_joke(self, ev: JokeEvent) -> StopEvent:
        joke = ev.joke

        prompt = f"Give a thorough analysis and critique of the following joke: {joke}"
        response = await self.llm.acomplete(prompt)
        return StopEvent(result=str(response))

w = JokeFlow(timeout=60, verbose=False)
result = await w.run(topic="pirates")
print(str(result))
```

### Step 5: View Traces in Langfuse

After running your workflow, log in to [Langfuse](https://cloud.langfuse.com) to explore the generated traces. You will see logs for each workflow step along with metrics such as token counts, latencies, and execution paths.

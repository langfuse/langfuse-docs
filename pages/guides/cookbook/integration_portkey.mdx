# Observability for Portkey LLM Gateway with Langfuse

This guide shows you how to integrate Portkey's AI gateway with Langfuse. Portkey's API endpoints are fully [compatible](https://portkey.ai/docs/api-reference/inference-api/introduction) with the OpenAI SDK, allowing you to trace and monitor your AI applications seamlessly.

> **What is Portkey?** [Portkey](https://portkey.ai/) is an AI gateway that provides a unified interface to interact with 250+ AI models, offering advanced tools for control, visibility, and security in your Generative AI apps.

> **What is Langfuse?** [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is an open source LLM engineering platform that helps teams trace LLM calls, monitor performance, and debug issues in their AI applications.

<Steps>
## Step 1: Install Dependencies


```python
%pip install openai langfuse portkey_ai
```

## Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

Next, set up your Langfuse API keys. You can get these keys by signing up for a free [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com/) account or by [self-hosting Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting). These environment variables are essential for the Langfuse client to authenticate and send data to your Langfuse project.


```python
import os

# Get keys for your project from the project settings page: https://cloud.langfuse.com
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇪🇺 EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇺🇸 US region
```


```python
from langfuse import get_client
 
get_client().auth_check()
```




    True



## Step 3: Use Langfuse OpenAI Drop-in Replacement

Next, you can use Langfuse’s OpenAI-compatible client (from langfuse.openai import OpenAI) to trace all requests sent through the Portkey gateway. For detailed setup instructions on the LLM gateway and virtual LLM keys, refer to the [Portkey documentation](https://portkey.ai/docs/product/ai-gateway).


```python
from langfuse.openai import OpenAI
from portkey_ai import createHeaders, PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL#

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="xxx", #Since we are using a virtual key we do not need this 
    base_url = PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL, 
    default_headers = createHeaders(
    api_key = "***",
    virtual_key = "***"
    )
)
```

## Step 4: Run an Example


```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4o",  # Or any model supported by your chosen provider
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What are the benefits of using an AI gateway?"},
  ],
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)

# Flush via global client
langfuse = get_client()
langfuse.flush()
```

## Step 5: See Traces in Langfuse

After running the example, log in to Langfuse to view the detailed traces, including:

- Request parameters
- Response content
- Token usage and latency metrics
- LLM model information through Portkey gateway

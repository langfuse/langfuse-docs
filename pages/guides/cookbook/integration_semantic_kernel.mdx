_**Note:** This guide focuses on the Python implementation. However, the principles of this Langfuse integration apply to other languages supported by Semantic Kernel, including [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/concepts/enterprise-readiness/observability/?pivots=programming-language-csharp) and [Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/concepts/enterprise-readiness/observability/?pivots=programming-language-java)._
</Callout>

## Getting Started

Let's walk through a practical example of using Semantic Kernel and integrating it with Langfuse for comprehensive tracing.

<Steps>
### Step 1: Install Dependencies

<Callout type="info" emoji="⚠️">
_**Note:** This notebook utilizes the Langfuse OTel Python SDK v3. For users of Python SDK v2, a previous version of this guide is available [here](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-docs/blob/4bba7985939469dab76b04513221995a203ac3c7/cookbook/integration_semantic_kernel.ipynb#L4)._
</Callout>


```python
%pip install "langfuse>=3.0.0b2" openlit semantic-kernel
```


### Step 2: Configure Langfuse SDK

Next, set up your Langfuse API keys. You can obtain these keys by signing up for a free [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com/) account or by [self-hosting Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting). These environment variables are essential for the Langfuse client to authenticate and send data to your Langfuse project.

The code below demonstrates how to set these environment variables. Remember to replace the placeholder values with your actual Langfuse public key, secret key, and host, as well as your OpenAI API key and desired model ID.


```python
import os

# Get keys for your project from the project settings page at https://cloud.langfuse.com
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇪🇺 EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇺🇸 US region

# Your OpenAI key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-proj-..."
os.environ["OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL_ID"] = "gpt-4o"
```

With the environment variables set, we can now initialize the Langfuse client. This client will be used to interact with the Langfuse API.
The `get_client()` function initializes the Langfuse client using the credentials provided in the environment variables.


```python
from langfuse import get_client
 
langfuse = get_client()
 
# Verify connection
if langfuse.auth_check():
    print("Langfuse client is authenticated and ready!")
else:
    print("Authentication failed. Please check your credentials and host.")
```

    Langfuse client is authenticated and ready!


### Step 3: Initialize OpenLit for Instrumentation

Now, we initialize the [OpenLit instrumentation SDK](https://docs.openlit.io/latest/sdk-configuration). OpenLit automatically instruments Semantic Kernel and exports OpenTelemetry (OTel) spans to Langfuse. This allows for seamless tracing of your Semantic Kernel operations.

The `openlit.init()` function is configured to use the Langfuse OTel tracer and disables batching (`disable_batch=True`) to ensure traces are processed and sent immediately, which is useful for development and debugging.


```python
import openlit

# Initialize OpenLIT instrumentation. The disable_batch flag is set to true to process traces immediately. Also set the langfuse tracer to use the langfuse tracer.
openlit.init(tracer=langfuse._otel_tracer, disable_batch=True)
```

### Step 4: Basic Semantic Kernel Application

Let's create a straightforward Semantic Kernel application. In this example, an Assistant agent will answer a user's question. This will serve as the foundation for demonstrating Langfuse tracing.


```python
from semantic_kernel import Kernel
from semantic_kernel.connectors.ai.open_ai import OpenAIChatCompletion

kernel = Kernel()

kernel.add_service(
    OpenAIChatCompletion(),
)
```


```python
from semantic_kernel.prompt_template import InputVariable, PromptTemplateConfig

prompt = """{{$input}}
Answer the question above.
"""

prompt_template_config = PromptTemplateConfig(
    template=prompt,
    name="summarize",
    template_format="semantic-kernel",
    input_variables=[
        InputVariable(name="input", description="The user input", is_required=True),
    ]
)

summarize = kernel.add_function(
    function_name="summarizeFunc",
    plugin_name="summarizePlugin",
    prompt_template_config=prompt_template_config,
)
```

### Step 5: Run the Application

With the Semantic Kernel application set up, let's invoke it with a sample question and print the response. OpenLit will automatically capture this interaction and send the trace data to Langfuse.


```python
input_text = "What is Langfuse?"

summary = await kernel.invoke(summarize, input=input_text)

print(summary)
```

    Langfuse is a tool designed for monitoring and observability specifically in AI systems. It helps organizations keep track of machine learning models, natural language processing systems, or any AI-driven applications. Langfuse typically provides features like real-time monitoring, logging, and analytics to understand how AI models are performing, diagnose issues, and ensure reliability and efficiency in AI operations. By offering insights into the behavior of AI systems, Langfuse aids developers and data scientists in optimizing and maintaining their models effectively.



### Step 6: View Traces in Langfuse

After executing the Semantic Kernel application, navigate to your Langfuse Trace Table. You will find detailed traces of the application's execution, providing insights into the LLM calls, inputs, outputs, and performance metrics. Below is an example screenshot illustrating how a trace appears in Langfuse:

![Langfuse Trace of Semantic Kernel Application](https://langfuse.com/images/cookbook/integration-semantic-kernel/sematric-kernel-example-trace.png)

For a live example, you can explore this public trace: [Langfuse Semantic Kernel Trace Example](https://cloud.langfuse.com/project/cloramnkj0002jz088vzn1ja4/traces/51d7ea51af5cf9048f607ac6abb79b4f?timestamp=2025-06-04T08:17:14.026Z&display=details)
</Steps>

## Add Additional Attributes

Langfuse allows you to pass additional attributes to your spans. These can include `user_id`, `tags`, `session_id`, and custom `metadata`. Enriching traces with these details is important for effective analysis, debugging, and monitoring of your application's behavior across different users or sessions.

The following code demonstrates how to start a custom span with `langfuse.start_as_current_span` and then update the trace associated with this span using `span.update_trace()`. This allows you to log specific inputs, outputs, and other relevant information directly to Langfuse.

→ Learn more about [Updating Trace and Span Attributes](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python/sdk-v3#updating-observations).


```python
with langfuse.start_as_current_span(
    name="semantic-kernel-trace",
    ) as span:
    
    # Run your application here
    question = "What is Langfuse?"
    response = await kernel.invoke(summarize, input=question)
    response = response.value[0].items[0].text
    print(response)

    # Pass additional attributes to the span
    span.update_trace(
        input=question,
        output=response,
        user_id="user_123",
        session_id="session_abc",
        tags=["agent", "semantic-kernel"],
        metadata={"email": "user@langfuse.com"},
        version="1.0.0"
        )

# Flush events in short-lived applications
langfuse.flush()
```

    Langfuse is a developer tool designed for monitoring, debugging, and continuously improving applications that utilize Large Language Models (LLMs). It allows developers to track and analyze API requests to natural language processing (NLP) services such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and others. By using Langfuse, developers can gain insights into the performance and effectiveness of their language models, identify any issues or errors, and refine the application's functionality to optimize results. The tool provides metrics and visualizations to facilitate better understanding and decision-making in the context of AI-driven applications.


## Score Traces and Spans

Langfuse lets you can ingest custom scores for individual spans or entire traces. This scoring workflow enables you to implement custom quality checks at runtime or facilitate human-in-the-loop evaluation processes.

In the example below, we demonstrate how to score a specific span for `conciseness` (a numeric score) and the overall trace for `feedback` (a categorical score). This helps in systematically assessing and improving your application.

→ Learn more about [Custom Scores in Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/custom).


```python
with langfuse.start_as_current_span(
    name="semantic-kernel-trace",
    ) as span:
    
    # Run your application here
    question = "What is Langfuse?"
    response = await kernel.invoke(summarize, input=question)
    response = response.value[0].items[0].text
    print(response)
    
    # Score this specific span
    span.score(name="conciseness", value=0.8, data_type="NUMERIC")

    # Score the overall trace
    span.score_trace(name="feedback", value="positive", data_type="CATEGORICAL")

# Flush events in short-lived applications
langfuse.flush()
```

    Langfuse is a platform designed to help developers and businesses monitor and troubleshoot their large language model (LLM) applications. It provides tools for observability and performance tracking, enabling users to understand how their applications are interacting with language models and performing in real-time. By offering insights into model use, error analysis, and user interactions, Langfuse aims to enhance the efficiency and reliability of applications that depend on LLMs.


## Manage Prompts with Langfuse

Langfuse Prompt Management allows you to collaboratively create, version, and deploy prompts. You can manage prompts either through the Langfuse SDK or directly within the Langfuse UI. These managed prompts can then be fetched into your application at runtime and automatically linked to the traces that utilize them, ensuring traceability and facilitating A/B testing or version control.

The code below illustrates fetching a prompt named `answer-question` from Langfuse, compiling it with an input variable (`country`), and then using this compiled prompt in our Semantic Kernel application. The resulting generation is then linked back to the specific Langfuse prompt version used.

→ Get started with [Langfuse Prompt Management](https://langfuse.com/docs/prompts/get-started).


```python
# Fetch the prompt from langfuse
langfuse_prompt = langfuse.get_prompt(name="answer-question")

# Compile the prompt with the input
compiled_prompt = langfuse_prompt.compile(country = "France")

# Run your application
with langfuse.start_as_current_span(
    name="semantic-kernel-trace",
    ) as span:
    
    # Run your application here
    question = compiled_prompt
    print("question:", question)
    response = await kernel.invoke(summarize, input=question)
    response = response.value[0].items[0].text
    print("response:", response)

    # Link the prompt to the trace
    langfuse.update_current_generation(prompt = langfuse_prompt)

# Flush events in short-lived applications
langfuse.flush()
```

    question: What is the capital of France?
    response: The capital of France is Paris.


## Dataset Experiments

Offline evaluation using datasets is a critical part of the LLM development lifecycle. Langfuse supports this through Dataset Experiments. The typical workflow involves:

1.  **Benchmark Dataset**: Defining a dataset with input prompts and their corresponding expected outputs.
2.  **Application Run**: Running your LLM application against each item in the dataset.
3.  **Evaluation**: Comparing the generated outputs against the expected results or using other scoring mechanisms (e.g., model-based evaluation) to assess performance.

The following example demonstrates how to use a pre-existing dataset containing countries and their capitals to run an experiment.

→ Learn more about [Langfuse Dataset Experiments](https://langfuse.com/docs/datasets/overview).


```python
from langfuse import get_client
 
langfuse = get_client()
 
# Fetch an existing dataset
dataset = langfuse.get_dataset(name="capital_cities_11")
for item in dataset.items:
    print(f"Input: {item.input["country"]}, Expected Output: {item.expected_output}")
```

    Input: USA, Expected Output: Washington, D.C.
    Input: Egypt, Expected Output: Cairo
    Input: South Africa, Expected Output: Pretoria
    Input: Argentina, Expected Output: Buenos Aires
    Input: South Korea, Expected Output: Seoul
    Input: Canada, Expected Output: Ottawa
    Input: India, Expected Output: New Delhi
    Input: Japan, Expected Output: Tokyo
    Input: Brazil, Expected Output: Brasília
    Input: Spain, Expected Output: Madrid
    Input: Italy, Expected Output: Rome


Next, we iterate through each item in the dataset, run our Semantic Kernel application (`your_application`) with the item's input, and log the results as a run associated with that dataset item in Langfuse. This allows for structured evaluation and comparison of different application versions or prompt configurations.

The `item.run()` context manager is used to create a new trace for each dataset item processed in the experiment. Optionally you can score the dataset runs. 


```python
from langfuse import get_client
 
langfuse = get_client()
dataset_name = "capital_cities_11"
current_run_name = "capital_cities_run_02" # Identifies this specific evaluation run
current_run_metadata={"model_provider": "OpenAI", "temperature_setting": 0.7},
current_run_description="Evaluation run for Q&A model on June 4th"
 
# Assume 'your_application' is your instrumented application function
async def your_application(question):
    with langfuse.start_as_current_span(name="semantic-kernel-trace") as span:

        answer = await kernel.invoke(summarize, input=question)
        answer = answer.value[0].items[0].text
 
        # Update the trace with the input and output
        span.update_trace(
            input=  question,
            output= answer,
        )
 
        return answer
 
dataset = langfuse.get_dataset(name=dataset_name) # Fetch your pre-populated dataset
 
for item in dataset.items:
    print(f"Running evaluation for item: {item.id} (Input: {item.input["country"]})")
 
    # Use the item.run() context manager
    with item.run(
        run_name=current_run_name,
        run_metadata=current_run_metadata,
        run_description=current_run_description
    ) as root_span: 
        # All subsequent langfuse operations within this block are part of this trace.
        generated_answer = await your_application(
            question="What is the capital of " + item.input["country"] + "? Just answer with the name of the city.",
        )
 
        # Optionally, score the result against the expected output
        if item.expected_output and generated_answer == item.expected_output:
            root_span.score_trace(name="exact_match", value=1.0)
        else:
            root_span.score_trace(name="exact_match", value=0.0)
 
print(f"\nFinished processing dataset '{dataset_name}' for run '{current_run_name}'.")
```

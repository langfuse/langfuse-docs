# Observability for xAI / Grok with Langfuse

This guide shows you how to integrate Grok with Langfuse using the OpenAI SDK.

> **What is Grok?** Grok is X.ai’s advanced AI platform that streamlines natural language processing for intelligent application integration. Learn more at [Grok Documentation](https://docs.x.ai/docs).

> **What is Langfuse?** [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is an open source LLM engineering platform that helps teams trace API calls, monitor performance, and debug issues in their AI applications.

<Steps>
## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Make sure you have installed the necessary Python packages:


```python
%pip install openai langfuse
```

## Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables


```python
import os

# Get keys for your project from the project settings page
# https://cloud.langfuse.com

os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇪🇺 EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇺🇸 US region


# Get your Grok API key from your Grok account settings
os.environ["GROK_API_KEY"] = "xai-..."
```

## Step 3: Use Grok with the OpenAI SDK

To utilize Grok through the OpenAI SDK, we use the Langfuse drop-in replacement for OpenAI. Replace the base URL with Grok’s endpoint.


```python
# Instead of importing openai directly:
from langfuse.openai import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
  api_key=os.environ.get("GROK_API_KEY"),
  base_url="https://api.x.ai/v1"  # Grok's endpoint
)
```

## Step 4: Run an Example

The following example demonstrates how to make a simple request using Grok's API. All API calls will be automatically traced by Langfuse.


```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="grok-2-latest",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are an assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is Langfuse?"}
  ],
  name = "Grok-2-Trace"
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Step 5: Enhance Tracing (Optional)

You can enhance your Grok traces:

- Add [metadata](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing-features/metadata), [tags](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing-features/tags), [log levels](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing-features/log-levels) and [user IDs](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing-features/users) to traces
- Group traces by [sessions](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing-features/sessions)
- [`@observe()` decorator](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python/decorators) to trace additional application logic
- Use [Langfuse Prompt Management](https://langfuse.com/docs/prompts/get-started) and link prompts to traces
- Add [score](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/custom) to traces

Visit the [OpenAI SDK cookbook](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/openai/python/examples) to see more examples on passing additional parameters.
Find out more about Langfuse Evaluations and Prompt Management in the [Langfuse documentation](https://langfuse.com/docs).


## Step 6: See Traces in Langfuse

After running the example, log in to Langfuse to view the detailed traces, including:

- Request parameters
- Response content
- Token usage and latency metrics

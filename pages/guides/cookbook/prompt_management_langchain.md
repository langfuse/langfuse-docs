# Example: Langfuse Prompt Management with Langchain (Python)

[Langfuse Prompt Management](https://langfuse.com/docs/prompts) helps to version control and manage prompts collaboratively in one place. This example demostrates how to use prompts managed in Langchain applications.

_In addition, we use [Langfuse Tracing](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing) via the native [Langchain integration](https://langfuse.com/integrations/frameworks/langchain) to inspect and debug the Langchain application._

## Setup


```python
%pip install langfuse langchain langchain-openai --upgrade
```


```python
import os

# Get keys for your project from the project settings page: https://cloud.langfuse.com
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ US region

# Your openai key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-proj-..."
```


```python
from langfuse import get_client
from langfuse.langchain import CallbackHandler

# Initialize Langfuse client (prompt management)
langfuse = get_client()

# Initialize Langfuse CallbackHandler for Langchain (tracing)
langfuse_callback_handler = CallbackHandler()
```

## Add prompt to Langfuse Prompt Management

We add the prompt used in this example via the SDK. Alternatively, you can also edit and version the prompt in the Langfuse UI.

- `Name` that identifies the prompt in Langfuse Prompt Management
- Prompt with prompt template incl. `{{input variables}}`
- Config including `model_name` and `temperature`
- `labels` to include `production` to immediately use prompt as the default


```python
langfuse.create_prompt(
    name="event-planner",
    prompt=
    "Plan an event titled {{Event Name}}. The event will be about: {{Event Description}}. "
    "The event will be held in {{Location}} on {{Date}}. "
    "Consider the following factors: audience, budget, venue, catering options, and entertainment. "
    "Provide a detailed plan including potential vendors and logistics.",
    config={
        "model":"gpt-4o",
        "temperature": 0,
    },
    labels=["production"]
);
```

## Example application

### Get current prompt version from Langfuse


```python
# Get current production version of prompt
langfuse_prompt = langfuse.get_prompt("event-planner")
```

```python
print(langfuse_prompt.prompt)
```

```
Plan an event titled {{Event Name}}. The event will be about: {{Event Description}}. The event will be held in {{Location}} on {{Date}}. Consider the following factors: audience, budget, venue, catering options, and entertainment. Provide a detailed plan including potential vendors and logistics.
 ```

### Transform into Langchain PromptTemplate

Use the utility method `.get_langchain_prompt()` to transform the Langfuse prompt into a string that can be used in Langchain.

Context: Langfuse declares input variables in prompt templates using double brackets (`{{input variable}}`). Langchain uses single brackets for declaring input variables in PromptTemplates (`{input variable}`). The utility method `.get_langchain_prompt()` replaces the double brackets with single brackets.

Also, pass the Langfuse prompt as metadata to the PromptTemplate to automatically link generations that use the prompt.


```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

langchain_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
        langfuse_prompt.get_langchain_prompt(),
        metadata={"langfuse_prompt": langfuse_prompt},
    )
```

Extract the configuration options from `prompt.config`


```python
model = langfuse_prompt.config["model"]
temperature = str(langfuse_prompt.config["temperature"])
print(f"Prompt model configurations\nModel: {model}\nTemperature: {temperature}")
```

    Prompt model configurations
    Model: gpt-4o
    Temperature: 0


### Create Langchain chain based on prompt


```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model=model, temperature=temperature)

chain = langchain_prompt | model
```

## Invoke chain


```python
example_input = {
    "Event Name": "Wedding",
    "Event Description": "The wedding of Julia and Alex, a charming couple who share a love for art and nature. This special day will celebrate their journey together with a blend of traditional and contemporary elements, reflecting their unique personalities.",
    "Location": "Central Park, New York City",
    "Date": "June 5, 2024"
}
```


```python
# we pass the callback handler to the chain to trace the run in Langfuse
response = chain.invoke(input=example_input,config={"callbacks":[langfuse_callback_handler]})

print(response.content)
```

    To plan an event titled "{Event Name}" in Central Park, New York City on June 5, 2024, we need to consider several key factors: audience, budget, venue, catering options, and entertainment. Below is a detailed plan to ensure the event is successful and memorable.

# Langfuse Prompt Management Performance Test

This notebook conducts a performance benchmark on Langfuse Prompt Management by measuring the latency of retrieving and compiling a prompt without caching (cache_ttl_seconds=0) over 1,000 sequential executions.

In practice, this latency does not matter as the prompt is cached client-side in the SDKs. Learn more about caching in the [Langfuse Prompt Management documentation](https://langfuse.com/docs/prompt-management/features/caching).

The test accounts for network latency, so absolute values may vary based on geography and load. Use the histogram and summary statistics to compare relative improvements, such as between SDK versions or caching settings.

The test requires a prompt named `perf-test` to be set up in the authenticated project.

# Why does Langfuse exist?

> We accelerate the deployment of useful AI applications by building the OSS tooling layer for AI application developers

### Worldview

AI can create so much value for society and drive meaningful economic growth. We are still at the very early stages (est < 1% compared to what we will see over the next years). Every (successful) company will be an AI company with AI at the core of it's strategy, value creation, and business processes.

Most of value creation will happen at the application-layer, both by enterprises/incumbants who own the transaction/process and by AI-native startups.

### Today

While using models as black-boxes, these teams face a lot of challenges when trying to make their applications useful/safe/scalable/exaplainable/cheap:

- visibility/explainability of applications/agents --> Langfuse Observability
- collaboration in interdisciplinary teams --> Langfuse Prompt Management, sharable views/dashboards
- evaluation, dataset management, labeling --> Langfuse Evaluations

### Where are we going?

Which issues are most pressing will change over time. Model capabilities increase, inference gets cheaper, models can "rip" on problems for longer. If a large enterprise had an unlimited quantity of "1 week of phd-level intelligence" available, it's certain that many backoffice tasks are solveable. Focus will shift from "how to make it work/useful" to "how does it work and what is even happening".

We are building Langfuse to help today's and tomorrow's AI application builders.

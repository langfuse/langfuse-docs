# Why does Langfuse exist?

> Accelerate the deployment of useful AI applications/agents

### Today

AI will create so much value for society and drive meaningful economic growth. This change is still at the very early stages (est < 1% compared to what we will see over the next years). Every (successful) company will be an AI company with AI at the core of its strategy, value creation, and business processes. Most of value creation will happen at the application-layer and will be split between incumbents and AI-native startups.

Today, the actual blocker to more deployments is that teams face a lot of challenges when trying to make their applications useful, safe, scalable, explainable, and cheap.

We focus on building the integrated and [open](/handbook/chapters/open-source) tooling layer to help solve these issues faster:

- Visibility/explainability of applications/agents --> Langfuse Observability
- Collaboration in interdisciplinary teams as ML, engineering and domain knowledge is required --> Langfuse Prompt Management, sharable views/dashboards
- Evaluation, dataset management, labeling --> Langfuse Evaluations

### Where are we going?

The ecosystem and what's most important changes rapidly over time. Model capabilities increase, inference gets cheaper, models can work on problems for longer. If a large enterprise had an unlimited quantity of "1 week of phd-level intelligence" available, it's certain that many back-office tasks are solvable even without a lot of optimization and supervision. Focus will shift from "how to make it work/useful" to "how does it work and what is even happening".

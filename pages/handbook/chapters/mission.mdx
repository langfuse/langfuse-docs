# Why does Langfuse exist?

> We build open-source tools for Agent/Application developers to accelerate deployment of AI

1. AI can create so much value for society and drive meaningful economic growth
   - Given how much industries can be transformed by AI, we are still at the very early stages (est < 1% compared to what we will see over the next years)
   - Every (successful) company will be an AI company with AI at the core of it's strategy
2. Most of value creation will happen at the application-layer, either by enterprises/incumbants who own the transaction/process or by startups building new products
3. Application-layer deployment is hard
   - Visibility/explainability problem
   - Collaboration problem
   - Evaluation problem
   - Security problem
   - Experimentation driven development needed which is hard to do in a cross-functional engineering team
4. Open-source tooling can help accelerate this development. We build what the most sophisticated teams need to day and everyone else needs tomorrow.

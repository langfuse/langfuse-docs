# How does Langfuse make money?

Langfuse is a commercial [open source](/handbook/chapters/open-source) company. We monetize by offering Langfuse Cloud as a fully managed service. Langfuse OSS can be [freely self-hosted](/self-hosting) without scalability or performance limitations compared to Langfuse Cloud and we do not sell commercial support for it.

Value proposition of Langfuse Cloud:

- Cost-effective compared to self-hosting due to shared infrastructure and overhead
- Scales with your usage without needing to maintain or upgrade infrastructure
- Includes top-tier [support](/support) by the core team
- Always up-to-date with the latest features and bug fixes

# How does Langfuse make money?

Langfuse is a commercial [open source](/handbook/chapters/open-source) company. We monetize by offering Langfuse Cloud as a fully managed service. 

Langfuse OSS can be [freely self-hosted](/self-hosting) without scalability or performance limitations compared to Langfuse Cloud and we do not sell commercial support for it.

## How we think about pricing
- Langfuse prices should always be a no-brainer for customers to understand and agree with.
- We think charging per seat is so 2010. Usage based pricing is the future.
- All our products should be free to use for small scale or side projects forever; we do this through self-hosting or our Hobby plan.
- We love economies of scale in our Cloud infrastructure; we are working hard to lower (instead of raising) prices wherever possible.
- We only want to monetize customers who get real value from Langfuse; if a customer is unhappy and not using us we are easy going about refunds.


## Value proposition of Langfuse Cloud

- Cost-effective compared to self-hosting due to shared infrastructure and overhead
- Infrastructure and [pricing](/pricing) that scales with your usage without needing to maintain or upgrade infrastructure

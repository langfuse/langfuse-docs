# Who are we?

We are a group of experienced engineers and ex-founders who are passionate about building the leading open-source LLM engineering platform.

We love working with our OSS community who shares ideas, reports bugs, and makes contributions to Langfuse (see [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)).

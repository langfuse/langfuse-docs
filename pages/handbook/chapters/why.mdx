## Built for Complex Use Cases

- We designed Langfuse with complex, nested LLM calls in mind.
- Langfuse enables hierarchical representations of your application in [traces](/docs/tracing). Why are traces the core abstraction for LLMOps? Learn more in this [webinar](/guides/videos/webinar-observability-llm-systems).
- We go beyond Input/Output to include all the context of your app.

## Built for Scale

import EnterpriseCloudScale from "@/components-mdx/enterprise-cloud-scale.mdx";

# Langfuse Community Hour

## What is the Langfuse Community Hour?

The Langfuse Community Hour is our regular meetup for answering user questions, sharing ideas, experiences, and best practices.

We keep these sessions fun and hands-on, helping users with topics such as:

- Questions about Langfuse
- Improving your evaluation & testing setup
- General chat about building LLM applications

## How to schedule the Langfuse Community Hour?

1. **Create a new event in our Langfuse Lu.ma Calendar**: https://luma.com/langfuse
   - Past events can be cloned when clicking on "manage event" -> "more" -> "Clone Event".
   - Add a "Blast" to the event that reminds people 2 hours before the event.
   - Use the Lu.ma invite function to invite all past participants of our community hour.

2. **Create a new Google Calendar invite** to have a Google Meet link for the event.
   - Change the permissions of the event so everyone can join without host approval (meeting access type = open).
   - Add all participants from the Langfuse team as meeting hosts.

3. **Remind our community on Social media** about the community hour.
   - Use our social tool assembly to post a reminder on Monday.

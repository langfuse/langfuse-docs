# Scheduling Community Hour

## What is the Langfuse community and why are we doing this?

The Langfuse community is very important to shape the Langfuse project and this is the regular space for the community to exchange thoughts, ideas and best practices.

### Event description

"We want this to be a fun, hands-on session in which we can help you with:

- Questions about Langfuse
- Improving your eval & testing setup
- General chat about building LLM apps

Please bring questions or just come to hang out.

Where: Google Meet (link is in the invite)"

## How to schedule the community hour?

1. **Create a new event in our Langfuse Lu.ma Calendar**: https://luma.com/langfuse
   - Past events can be cloned when clicking on "manage event" -> "more" -> "Clone Event".
   - Add a "Blast" to the event that reminds people 2 hours before the event.
   - Use the Lu.ma invite function to invite all past participants of our community hour.

2. **Create a new Google Calendar invite** to have a Google Meet link for the event.
   - Change the permissions of the event so everyone can join without host approval (meeting access type = open).
   - Add all participants from the Langfuse team as meeting hosts.

3. **Remind our community on Social media** about the community hour.
   - Use our social tool assembly to post a reminder on Monday.

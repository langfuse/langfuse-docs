# Super Day

The Super Day is a full onsite day in our office where we work together with you on real problems you might tackle in your future role at Langfuse. The goal is to simulate working together for a day—a trial run for both sides to determine whether we enjoy collaborating, coding, and problem-solving together.

We expect this investment from you, and we make the same investment ourselves to ensure we hire the best people for our team.

- **Start time:** 9:30 AM
- **Location:** [Our office](/find-us)
- **End time:** ~5:30 PM


## Preparation

We expect everyone participating in a Super Day to be genuinely interested in joining Langfuse and to have completed the following preparation:

**Everyone:**
- Read the [handbook](/handbook) from top to bottom
- Read the [documentation](/docs) thoroughly to understand the product and how it works
- Understand who our users are and what problems they're trying to solve
- Review our data models in [Postgres](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/main/packages/shared/prisma/schema.prisma) and [Clickhouse](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/0b8ad96b18ca4763df0a62deaac39d58a0a607c4/packages/shared/clickhouse/migrations/clustered) how we persist data. We have dedicated data model docs in our product documentation:
  - [Observability data model](/docs/observability/data-model)
  - [Scores data model](/docs/evaluation/evaluation-methods/data-model)
  - [Experiments data model](/docs/evaluation/experiments/data-model)
  - [Prompt management data model](/docs/prompt-management/data-model)


**Product & Backend Engineers:**
- Be proficient in SQL—many of our onsite challenges rely on SQL logic
- Complete local dev setup:
    - If you want to code in TypeScript, set up our [repository](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse) by following the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
    - If you want to code in a language of your choice, set up a scaffold project beforehand and prepare to connect to the spawned and seeded Clickhouse database (see the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for database setup)

**Frontend/Design Engineers:**
- Set up our [repository](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse) by following the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Pre-Onsite Sync

Before the Super Day, you'll have a brief sync with someone from the Langfuse team to discuss what the implementation part of the day will look like. This is also the perfect opportunity to address any questions you might have about the product, the role, or the company.


## Super Day Schedule


### System + Product Design Session (2.5 hours)

**9:30 AM - 11:45 AM** Participants: you, Max (CTO), Marc (CEO), and sometimes one of the engineers

We'll work together to think through a complex feature we want to add to Langfuse. The goal is to simulate how we arrive at a technical proposal for building that feature.

**Our philosophy:**
We're a team that thinks before we build. We want to see you thinking, making technical trade-offs, and reasoning about why you would choose one approach over another.

**Goal:**
By the end of the session, all of us should understand how we would build this feature. If someone were to start working on it immediately, there should be no surprises.

**Your role:**
- You can ask us questions at any time, especially about our users
- You're in the driver's seat
- You need to structure the session and ensure we cover the important topics. You manage the time, process, and discussion
- Typically this means: understanding the product requirements, translating them into technical requirements, and identifying the difficult technical choices
- Develop plans to overcome technical difficulties and make reasonable trade-offs


### Feedback (~15 minutes)

**11:45 AM - 12:00 PM** Participants: you, Max (CTO), Marc (CEO), and sometimes one of the engineers

After the morning session, Marc and Max will take a few minutes to discuss the session and provide you with feedback. We believe this is fair given the investment you're making. In the interest of time and fairness for everyone, we may decide not to continue with the afternoon session if we don't think we're a good fit for each other.


### Lunch

**12:00 PM - 1:00 PM** Participants: you and the team

This is your opportunity to meet the team, learn what they work on, and observe how they interact and collaborate. The team will answer any questions you may have.

### Implementation Session (~3 hours)

**1:00 PM - 4:00 PM** Participants: you, Max (CTO), and one of the engineers

We'll take something from the morning session and scope it down to something deliverable in about two hours.

**Process:**
1. Pre-discussion together (~30 minutes). Similar to the morning session, you will sit in the driver seat.
2. You work on the implementation in the team room (~2 hours)
3. Check-in and implementation review together (~30 minutes)

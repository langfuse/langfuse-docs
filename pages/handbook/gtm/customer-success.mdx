# Customer Success

Customer Success **owns the existing customer relationship** for customers that spend >1k/month in Langfuse. CS ensures that customers see value from using Langfuse. This helps us prevent churn and encourage expansion.

CS's goals are customer satisfaction (NPS) and expansion (revenue).

As a rule, customers should know what they can do within Langfuse, get the right pointers to achieve their goals and use Langfuse on the correct plan & usage patterns to receive reasonable bills.

## Principles

- Customer Success is our ear to customers. CS makes sure that we know how our customers are doing (health score)
- We show value to customers. CS is responsible for understanding what our customers want to achieve and which resources can help them make the most of Langfuse
- We are fast. We deal with Customer requests async & quick.
- We take customer requests and feedback seriously. We are building something people want. The easiest way to do this is by listening closely to them & understanding what works well and what needs to improve.

## Process

### Activities

- **Health Scoring**: Monitor customer health, identify customers who are at risk of churning, help them realize value of Langfuse
  - # Users in Langfuse (+ expansion)
  - # Traces (+ expansion/contraction)
  - Feature usage (# of features (tracing, evals, datasets, prompt mgmt))
  - $ bill (e.g. reach out if significant increase / decrease – help us/customers understand this before they receive a bill)
- **Expansion:** Drive cross-feature adoption as this leads to improved retention
  - Feature usage (# of features (tracing, evals, datasets, prompt mgmt))
  - Understand customer use case
  - → recommend ways for customer to increase value from Langfuse
- **Feedback:** Inform our roadmap & product vision
  - Take customer feedback / requests
    - For small/mid customers: use Linear Customer requests and link to backlog item (if exists)
    - For enterprise customers: set up partnership Google Doc with list of feature requests, can be revisited in future scheduled calls with them

### Segments

- **Small: 0-10k p.a.** → understand via metrics & automations
  - We manage this segment through aggregate data & automations (& together with the Growth Team)
  - No individual outreach & not core CS activity
- **Mid: 10-50k p.a.** → light touch (e.g. regular slack/email check-in, regular impersonation, schedule meeting if helpful/necessary)
  - This is our core segment. CS should know these companies. What do they work on, how do they use Langfuse? How is their account expanding/contracting? Are they happy with the product? What features are on their wishlist?
- **Enterprise: 50k+ p.a.** → high touch (e.g. quarterly meeting, named success manager, meeting links, shared success document)
  - This is our key account segment. We have a structured and high touch motion.
  - What we deliver to the customer depends on what we contract and may include:
    - Regular partnership meetings
    - Uptime & Support SLAs
    - Custom Legal Terms
    - Workshop/support hours with our team

### Other

- Setting up Slack Channels (link to support/plain)
- Hubspot
  - We track CS work in Hubspot (list of accounts & reviews/activities)
  - CS board in Hubspot

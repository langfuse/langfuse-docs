# Sales

Our company strategy is for our product to sell itself.

Many of our customers can just come in and buy without speaking to us. For other customers, it is, however, imperative to have a counterpart in our sales-team to adopt Langfuse successfully.

We like to think that the decision of both user groups is primarily based on how we [build & market](/handbook) our product and that sales removes friction for any organisation to onboard to Langfuse.

Sales at Langfuse is one team with ProductEng and Customer Success. Sales owns the decision to onboard; CS owns long-term value; Product/Eng owns roadmap. Everyone shares the customer outcome.

## Principles

- Sales helps customers adopt Langfuse and navigate friction.
- We build processes to navigate common corporate challenges in learning about, procuring and onboarding to Langfuse
- We default to inbound, product‑led and sales-assisted motions
- We don’t force calls; We are lightning‑fast and technically credible when users want help
- We experiment with outbound to product‑qualified leads (PQLs), but we avoid broad cold outbound.
- We don’t contract deliverables for individual customers. We are a small and fast-moving team. This only works if we work 1:n as much as possible.
- We walk away from deals that will add distraction to our organization.

## Processes

### Who do we work with & what do we sell?

  - Suss out details (e.g. two accounts, one in each data region, sign additional NDA, answer questions about security)
  - Get on a call with prospect
  - Plans: Langfuse Teams (USD 500/month base fee \+ usage) & Enterprise: starting at \~3k/month spend commit, 12 months commit

# How we Hire

Here is our core philosophy on hiring:
- Stay as small a team as possible
- We will only hire technical profiles in the near future
- If in doubt we rather miss a great candidate before hiring the wrong one
- If a candidate is not "hell yes" we should not hire them; there should be clear excitement from both sides throughout the process

## Hiring process

Most of the time we are hiring for engineering roles â€“ below you will find the process for these roles. The process might differ slightly for other roles.

<Steps>
### 1st Call
This is a very short call to chat about your application and answer any questions you might have. (**15-30min scheduled**)

### CV Deep Dive

In this Call typically you will meet a Founder to get to know you and your background. They will try to understand [1] your motivation to join Langfuse, [2] your past roles and [3] what you are looking for in a new role. (**30-45min scheduled**)

### Technical Interview

This step is only relevant for engineering roles. Other roles often go directly to the Super Day. 

You will meet an engineer from our team for this interview and you will [1] discuss past projects, [2] solve typical algorithm problems, [3] design a backend or frontend system (in miro / figma) depending on the role. (**75min scheduled** but often concludes after 45min)


### Super Day 

What the trace is a Super Day? We get that a lot. The Super Day is an onsite day in our office where we work together with you on real problems that you might work on in your future role at Langfuse. (**1 full day**)


### Meet the Founders

Up to this point you will have met one or two of the founders. We will make sure you have the chance to meet the other founders over short calls or during the Super Day. (**30-45min per founder not met**)

## 'Secrets' to ace the process
- We are writing our handbook and docs for a purpose, we love it when candidates clearly have read them and even used our product â€“ their questions are just so much better!
- We are excited about people who are clear about the specific role they want to take on and have a strong take on how to shape it. (i.e. applying for 4 very different roles usually confuses us)

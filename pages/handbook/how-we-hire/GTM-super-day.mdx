# GTM Super Day

The Super Day is a full onsite day in our office where we work together with you on real problems you might tackle in your future role at Langfuse. The goal is to simulate working together for a day—a trial run for both sides to determine whether we enjoy collaborating and problem-solving together. Here is an overview on [how we work](/handbook/how-we-work/principles) as a team.


- **Start time:** 10:30 AM
- **Location:** [Our office](/find-us)
- **End time:** ~5:30 PM

<Steps>
## Preparation for the Super Day

We expect everyone participating in a Super Day to be genuinely interested in joining Langfuse and to have prepared for the day:

**Everyone:**
- Read the [handbook](/handbook) from top to bottom
- Read the [documentation](/docs) to understand the product and how it works

**GTM Engineers:**
- Understand our ICP and value proposition 
- Check out our [Customer Stories](https://langfuse.com/customers)
- Read [Why customers choose Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/handbook/chapters/why) and [How does Langfuse make money](https://langfuse.com/handbook/chapters/monetization)

## Super Day: Morning

<Callout type="info">
**10:30 AM - 11:45 AM** Participants: you, Marc (CEO), Akio (GTM)
</Callout>

We'll do a mock customer conversation (VP Eng, Enterprise, Platform Team). You should use the Langfuse platform to demo the product end-to-end. We will send you instructions on how to set up your Langfuse environment a few days before the Super Day. We start the session by providing context to the exercise followed by a first mock conversation, feedback, and a second conversation. In addition, we'll take a look at our Inbound Lead process and discuss possible improvements. 

## Super Day: Feedback

<Callout type="info">
**11:45 AM - 12:00 PM** Participants: you, Max (CTO), Marc (CEO)
</Callout>

After the morning session, Marc and Akio will take a few minutes to discuss the session and provide you with feedback. We believe this is fair given the investment you're making. In the interest of time and fairness for everyone, we may decide not to continue with the afternoon session if we don't think we're a good fit for each other.


## Super Day: Lunch
<Callout type="info">
**12:00 PM - 1:00 PM** Participants: you and the team
</Callout>

Meet the team for lunch, learn what they work on, and observe how they collaborate. Ask any questions you have.

## Super Day: Afternoon

<Callout type="info">
**1:00 PM - 5:15 PM** Participants: you, Marc (CEO), Akio (GTM)
</Callout>

We will do a strategic discussion on GTM Strategy & implications, no prep necessary besides what's mentioned above.

## How to succeed on the Super Day

- Preparation: Prepare for the discussion by reading the documentation, understanding the product, and market.
- Show ownership and agency: Lead the discussion, drive decisions.
- Prioritize shipping: Cut scope intelligently, avoid perfection traps, and choose practical, “good enough” solutions.
- Be customer-focused: Ask clarifying questions, understand the “why,” and make tradeoffs based on user value.
- Demonstrate technical depth: Explain your reasoning, dive into details, and compare tradeoffs clearly.
- Communicate with clarity: Be direct, efficient, and explicit about what works, what doesn’t, and where you’re unsure.

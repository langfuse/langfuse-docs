## Hiring process

Most of the time we are hiring for engineering roles – below you will find the process for these roles. The process might differ slightly for other roles.

<Steps>

### 1st Call

This is a very short call to chat about your application and answer any questions you might have. The goal is to figure out whether working together could be an excellent fit for both sides.

**15-30min scheduled**

### CV Deep Dive

In this Call typically you will meet a Founder to get to know you and your background. They will try to understand [1] your motivation to join Langfuse, [2] your past roles and [3] what you are looking for in a new role. Be ready to talk in detail about your past projects and experiences.

**30-45min scheduled**

### Technical Interview

This step is only relevant for engineering roles. Other roles often go directly to the Super Day.

You will meet an engineer from our team for this interview and you will [1] discuss past projects, [2] solve typical algorithm problems, [3] design a backend or frontend system (in figjam or tool of your choice) depending on the role.

**75min scheduled** but often concludes after 45min

### Super Day

What the trace is a Super Day? We get that a lot. The Super Day is an onsite day in our office where we work together with you on real problems that you might work on in your future role at Langfuse. You will receive a brief ahead of time.

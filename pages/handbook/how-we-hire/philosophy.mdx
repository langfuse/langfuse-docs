# How we Hire

Our core philosophy:

- Stay as small a team as possible
- The recruiting process should generate meaningful signal for both sides, expose candidates to real work and a large share of the team
- If in doubt we rather miss a great candidate before bringing on the wrong one
- If a candidate is not "hell yes, I want to work at Langfuse" they should not join; there should be clear excitement from both sides throughout the process

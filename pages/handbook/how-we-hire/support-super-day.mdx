# Support Engineering Super Day

The Super Day is a full onsite day in our office where we work together with you on real problems you might tackle in your future role at Langfuse. The goal is to simulate working together for a day—a trial run for both sides to determine whether we enjoy collaborating, coding, and problem-solving together. Here is an overview on [how we work](/handbook/how-we-work/principles) as a team.


- **Start time:** 10:30 AM
- **Location:** [Our office](/find-us)
- **End time:** ~5:30 PM

<Steps>
## Preparation for the Super Day

We expect everyone participating in a Super Day to be genuinely interested in joining Langfuse and to have prepared for the day:

**Everyone:**
- Read the [handbook](/handbook) from top to bottom
- Read the [documentation](/docs) to understand the product and how it works


**Support Engineers:**
- Set up [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com/) and request LLM API keys if needed
- Read through [Github Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/categories/support) to get a feeling for our customers' requests


## Take-home Design Discussion Preparation
<Callout type="info">
**1-2 days prior to Super Day**<br/>
Expected time investment: ~2 hours
</Callout>

You'll receive a technical challenge in PDF format.

We'll set up a Whatsapp group where you can ask any questions about the challenge, the product context, or clarify requirements.

Once all questions are answered, you should take some time to prepare for the discussion during the Super Day. More on that below. No formal document is required to be submitted.
While working on this challenge, please take notes on Langfuse. What works well, what doesn't? What's counterintuitive? Where is the documentation weak?

## Super Day: Morning Session

<Callout type="info">
**10:30 AM - 11:45 AM** 
</Callout>

We'll discuss the challenge that we sent you in advance. Imagine you're already working at Langfuse and you want to demo what you've been working on. This means: you are in the driver's seat, you are responsible for explaining the app to the room and answering questions. We are there to help you and provide additional context where needed.

We start the session with a 15 minutes presentation by you on the preparation and your thoughts on how you built the app.

## Super Day: Feedback

<Callout type="info">
**11:45 AM - 12:00 PM** 
</Callout>

After the morning session, we will take a few minutes to discuss the session and provide you with feedback. We believe this is fair given the investment you're making. In the interest of time and fairness for everyone, we may decide not to continue with the afternoon session if we don't think we're a good fit for each other.


## Super Day: Lunch
<Callout type="info">
**12:00 PM - 1:00 PM** 
</Callout>

Meet the team for lunch, learn what they work on, and observe how they collaborate. Ask any questions you have.

## Super Day: Afternoon Session
<Callout type="info">
**1:00 PM - 3:00 PM** 
</Callout>

We discuss the ideas and feedback you gathered regarding Langfuse during the process. Here you have the chance to show how well you understand what we aim to achieve for our customers and how attentive you are to details that could improve customer experience in the future. 

## Super Day: Meet the co-founder
<Callout type="info">
**3:00 PM - 4:00 PM** 
</Callout>

Meet the co-founder you have not met in the process so far.


</Steps>

## How to succeed on the Super Day

- Preparation: Prepare for the discussion by reading the documentation, understanding the product, and document feedback you have. Prepare the app outlined in the briefing and think about your presentation of it in the morning session.
- Show ownership and agency: Lead the discussion, drive decisions, and think end-to-end about impact and failure modes.
- Prioritize shipping: Cut scope intelligently, avoid perfection traps, and choose practical, “good enough” solutions.
- Stay customer-focused: Ask clarifying questions, understand the “why,” and make tradeoffs based on user value.
- Demonstrate technical depth: Explain your reasoning, dive into details, and compare tradeoffs clearly.
- Communicate with clarity: Be direct, efficient, and explicit about what works, what doesn’t, and where you’re unsure.

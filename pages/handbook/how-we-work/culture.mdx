# Culture

## Shipping Above Little Else

When people join Langfuse, they often ask: "What's the strategy? What's the 5-year plan?" We don't have one, and that's intentional. 

Shipping is our strategy. We are extremely focused on shipping functionality—every week, over and over again. And it's working.

**Hot take**: We see many founders draft elaborate plans and "smart strategies." The only thing that matters is shipping. Don't make too many plans until year 3—that would be our advice. Every discussion about something that is not about shipping or shipping faster is wasted time.

Our focus often is on **things we can fix today**. This creates a constant forward momentum that compounds over time.

## In-Person Culture

We are an in-office culture. We have an office in Berlin, Germany and one in San Francisco. Most of our team and engineering specifically are based in Berlin. 

The things we build are complex and are moving really fast. We are playing to win. We believe this takes a level of communication that only in-person work can achieve.

So you are in the office 5 days a week? Not exactly. 
- We aim for 3-5 days in the office per week.
- Joining the office after lunch? No problem, if it gets you more productive
- 1 week remote per quarter? Easy! 

Basically, we do care about everyone having a base in Berlin / SF and showing up every week. 

Everyone is trusted to find a setup that gets them the most done. 

## High Trust / Extreme Autonomy

We own work end-to-end. Everyone runs their part of the product, including planning, design, implementation and support. We removed any bureaucracy trusting you to do the right thing. [link](https://www.mattswain.com/booknotes/no-rules-rules)

In practice, this means:

- **80% of work is shipped by a single person** without needing to collaborate. We expect people to decide themselves what to work on.
- **We don't care when you start or end your day**—we only care about shipping.
- **We get out of your way**. You have full autonomy to:
  - Decide what to work on
  - Spend money if you need to
  - Make technical decisions
  - Ship without asking for permission

## End-to-End Ownership

Real autonomy means real accountability:

- You ship a bug → You fix it
- Your documentation is confusing → You fix it
- Your feature creates a support ticket → You help the customer

No passing the buck, no "that's not my job." You own what you ship, completely.

## Maker Schedule

We have only 2 scheduled meetings per week: 15 min planning on Monday, 60 min demo on Friday. We collaborate where it makes sense, but we get impatient with time not shipping.

**In practice**: Sometimes it's silent in the office for a whole day if everyone is deep in the flow, shipping stuff. This is not awkward—it's productive. The [Maker Schedule](https://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) requires uninterrupted blocks of time, and we protect that religiously.

## Maker Communication
This is something a few new joiners or guests in our office have noticed: sometimes we pass entire days in the office without talking much. 

We are in a great spot where there is just so much to do that often there is little need to talk much. Lunch is our place for chit-chat and sync on what's happening.

Also, we create very few documents that are not directly related to getting something shipped. No strategy decks, no elaborate roadmaps, no theoretical discussions. If it doesn't help ship something, we don't spend time on it.

## Agency & Taste

On the team we care deeply about agency and taste. It's about knowing what good looks like and shipping improvements without needing permission. [link](https://www.benkuhn.net/impact)

Taste applies not only to **how** we create things, but especially to:

- **What to work on** in the first place
- **What quality level to ship at**: High quality vs. good enough vs. if at all
- **When to cut scope** vs. when to go deep
- **What's worth the time** vs. what's a distraction

We hire people who really want to get impressive stuff shipped and have strong intuition about these tradeoffs.

## Close to Customers

Everyone on the team must want to be very close to customers. This is non-negotiable. Everyone talks to multiple customers per day through:

- Slack support
- Email support
- GitHub issues and discussions
- Direct customer calls

This direct feedback loop is critical. When you ship something, you see the immediate impact. When you create friction, you feel it directly. This keeps everyone honest and focused on what matters.

## AI Native

We build tooling to enable the best product engineering teams. At the same time, we use LLMs to scale our work to the max. We generally try to go the extra mile in order to keep the team engineering-focused by automating most other business functions. Every member of the team has budget to spend on AI tooling to scale their work.

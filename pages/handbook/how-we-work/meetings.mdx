# Meetings

We have a small number of regular meetings. Generally, standing meetings are an anti-pattern and most things are better resolved adhoc/async.

## Weekly Meetings

**Mondays:** Week Ahead (15 min, full team) - What do I want to get done this week?

- Everyone has 1 minute. Be prepared to be specific about the major work items.
- Goal:
  - Help everyone with accountability/focus for the week
  - Identify dependencies and create opportunities for others to make quick suggestions/share context that is not yet known

**Fridays:** Demo (1h, full team) - What did I get done this week?

- Everyone has 2-4 minutes. Usually this involves screen sharing, but can also be a verbal summary.
- Goal: celebrate wins, share context of what is going on and interesting findings

## Bi-monthly

**Team Retro (1h, full team, often during lunch/dinner)**

- Goal: increase our effectiveness as a team
- Everyone prepares 0-3 start/continue/stop items; Figjam board shared ahead of the session in `#team-async`
- Meeting:
  1. Read through everyone's notes, add comments when something is unclear, add 3 dot-votes to notes that are most relevant to you
  2. Resolve open comments
  3. Discuss the highest-ranked notes based on dot votes
  4. Commit to changes that we want to make as a team

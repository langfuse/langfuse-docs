# Perks and Pay

In order to build one of the talent-densest places to work our compensation benefits are designed to value exceptional talent. We are trying to keep the absolute headcount small while constantly raising the bar of new talent joining instead of lowering it. 

To achieve this we are ready to pay above market talent and equity compensation. 

**General philosophy:**
- Top salaries + significant equity compensation 
- Flexibility to design your own compensation split 
- Adjust compensation according to employees life situation
- We are always aiming to make employment and equity contracts as candidate friendly as possible
- We regularly review and adjust the compensation of each employee to reflect their growth and contribution to the company  

## About our Equity Program

We desigend our equity program to be a no-brainer with significant upside that can actually make a financial difference to your life in case of a company success. 
- **ESOP program:** opportunity to hold real company shares: Real equity ownership with actual Common Stock shares (not phantom/virtual shares), giving you genuine stake in the company's success and potential upside at an exercise price of just $0.00001 per share.
- **10 year exercise window:** Industry-standard maximum term that gives you a full decade to exercise your options, providing flexibility to time your exercise based on personal financial planning and company performance.
- **Vesting terms:** Standard 4-year vesting with a 1-year cliff (25% after year one, then monthly thereafter) - the most common and employee-friendly structure in tech, ensuring early commitment is rewarded while providing steady monthly vesting momentum.
- **Terms on leaving the company:** Fair and standard provisions: you keep all vested options when you leave (exercisable for a defined period), while unvested options are forfeited - protecting your earned equity while aligning with industry norms that reward tenure.

## Perks

We are no fans of a long generic lists of perks. 

We think salary and equity should do most of the job, but here is some things that we think matter to our team: 
- **Talent Density:** People have joined Langfuse because they want to work with a team of pro's that know their craft. Many on the team say it's the best place they've worked so far.
- **Work time flexibility:** We are a team of pro's. We don't care when you start or end your day – we care about what gets shipped.
- **Berlin based Company with Bay Area presence:** Langfuse is based in Berlin and San Francisco and we encourage everyone to spend some time per year in the other location. 
- **Company retreat:** We love to spend 1 week per year all together in one beautiful location. Last year this was San Francisco; this year Portugal.
- **Almost no spending rules:** We believe in freedom and responsibility. You can expense things you need for work. Don't worry about it if it's a small one-time purchase (sub EUR 100) or a small recurring purchase (sub EUR 50). More details on [spending money](/handbook/tools-and-processes/spending-money).
- **Maker Schedule:** We believe in a maker schedule. We work when we are most productive and when we are most creative. We have only 2 scheduled meetings per week: 15 min planning on Monday, 60 min demo on Friday. We collaborate where it makes sense, but we get impatient with time not shipping. 
- **Working long = dinner on us:** Some of us like to ship stuff late at night. We will cover the dinner for you.

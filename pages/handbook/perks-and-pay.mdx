# Perks and Pay

In order to build one of the talent-densest places to work, our compensation benefits are designed to value exceptional talent. We are trying to keep the absolute headcount small while constantly raising the bar of new talent joining instead of lowering it.

To achieve this we are ready to pay above market salaries and equity compensation.

**General philosophy:**

- Top salaries + significant equity compensation
- We are always aiming to make employment and equity contracts as candidate friendly as possible
- We regularly review and adjust the compensation to reflect what's currently the top of market pay

## Perks

We are no fans of a long generic lists of perks.

We think salary and equity and a chance to do your life's work should do most of the job, but here is some things that we think matter to our team:

- **Talent Density:** People have joined Langfuse because they want to work with a team of pro's that know their craft. Many on the team say it's the best place they've worked so far.
- **Work time flexibility:** We are a team of pro's. We don't care when you start or end your day – we care about what gets shipped.
- **Two hubs, remote-first in Europe:** We operate out of San Francisco and Berlin. EU team members work remotely with one week per month in Berlin; Berlin and San Francisco team members use the office when it's helpful. See [Working Remotely](/handbook/how-we-work/remote).
- **Company retreats:** 2 times per year, the whole ClickHouse team comes together (e.g. in Tokyo in Spring 2026). In addition, we do another Langfuse-only offsite once per year. Last year this was Portugal.
- **Almost no spending rules:** We believe in freedom and responsibility. You can expense things you need for work. Don't worry about it if it's a small one-time purchase (sub USD 100) or a small recurring purchase (sub USD 50). More details on [spending money](/handbook/tools-and-processes/spending-money).
- **Maker Schedule:** We believe in a maker schedule. We work when we are most productive and when we are most creative. We have only 2 scheduled meetings per week: 15 min planning on Monday, 60 min demo on Friday. We collaborate where it makes sense, but we get impatient with time not shipping.
- **Working long = dinner on us:** Some of us like to ship stuff late at night. Dinner is on Langfuse.

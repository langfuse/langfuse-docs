# Documentation

_"Documentation is product"_ and we care a lot about it as it helps us efficiently scale to a large and growing community.
Docs are maintained by Product Engineering and GTM teams together; the [owner](/handbook/how-we-work/ownership) of a product feature/area is responsible to keep docs in order.

## How to make edits to Langfuse Documentation

The documentation page (and website) is in the [langfuse/langfuse-docs](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-docs) repo.
Follow the [README.md](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-docs/blob/master/README.md) to set up the project on your local machine.
Make changes via Pull Requests. Anyone can make changes, contributions welcome.

## How to write good technical documentation?

- Be clear about your objective and audience
- Include links to other related documentation pages
- Start high-level for novice users and incrementally build up customization/complexity when needed
- Familiarize yourself with [diataxis](https://diataxis.fr) and the difference of:
  - Tutorials
  - How-to Guides
  - References
  - Explanations
- For an exhaustive list of SDK configuration options or API routes, refer to references

## Changelog

For new capabilities and updates, we write [changelog](/changelog) posts.

Motivation:

- People who are using Langfuse should get new value by starting to use the new feature
- People who've been considering Langfuse for some time finally see the features from their wishlist and get started because of it
- People who aren't using Langfuse should think "this team ships"

## Documentation/Changelog Reviews

The [owner](/handbook/how-we-work/ownership) of a feature/area is responsible to maintain its documentation.

Sometimes it's hard though to write good docs if you are very much in the weeds. Felix and Jannik are happy to help with PR reviews to get the docs right.

No hard rules here, it's up to you:

- If changes were major or you think a 2nd pair of eyes makes sense (we're happy to take a look in any case!)
- If you added a headline (h2, h3) showing in the "on this page," it's probably worth a review
- If you're doing a changelog post, usually getting a review is a good idea

Steps:

1. Decide if you need a docs review and if it should be before or after feature release
2. Assign Felix or Jannik as reviewer on the docs change PR - they commit to same-day reviews. If it's too late in the day, then the next morning.
3. In most cases, we'll just release the docs for you and notify you; sometimes we might sync back

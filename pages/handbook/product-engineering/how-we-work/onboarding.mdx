# Onboarding at Langfuse

Welcome to Langfuse!

This document outlines how onboarding works for every new team member — what to expect on your first day, first week, first month, and beyond. Our goal is to help you quickly gain context, feel confident contributing, and become an owner of your area of the product.

At Langfuse, we lead with context, not control. We share the "why" and "what's important right now," so you can make the best decisions for our users. You'll get support, feedback, and guidance along the way — but you'll also have the space to take ownership early.


## Timeline Overview

| Milestone | Focus | Key Outcome |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Day 1** | Getting oriented | Understand company priorities and get set up |
| **Week 1** | Making your first contribution | Deploy your first change to production |

| **Month 6** | Becoming a go-to person | Own a product area and be a trusted domain expert |

---

## Day 1 — Getting Oriented

**Goal:** Understand company priorities and get set up for work.

- **Welcome meeting with Max (CTO)** — Context on company status, top priorities, challenges, and decision-making
- **Setup and access** — GitHub, Datadog, AWS, Slack, and local development environment
- **First task** — Small starter task to explore codebase and workflows. Goal: merge something within the first few days



## Week 1 — Making Your First Contribution

**Goal:** Deploy your first change to production and understand our systems.

By the end of Week 1:
- Fully working development setup
- Merged and deployed your first change
- Understand high-level architecture, CI/CD process, and monitoring
- Read and acknowledge policies (security, compliance, data handling)
- Engage in team communication

_We don't expect speed — we expect curiosity. Take the time to explore and ask "why."_



## Months 1-3 — Taking Ownership

**Goal:** Deliver your first independent project end-to-end.

By the end of Month 3, you should have:
- **Shipped an independent project** — Led a small feature or improvement from start to finish (technical planning, product thinking, implementation, documentation, user research)
- **Joined support rotation** — Started handling support tickets, seeing product through users' eyes, and maintaining your improvement backlog
- **Learned through reviews** — Received feedback on every PR from the team during your first ~2 months
- **Balanced priorities** — Demonstrated ability to align your backlog (support, fixes, improvements) with company priorities
- **Contributed to planning** — Participated in planning discussions


## Month 6 — Becoming a Go-To Person

**Goal:** Own a product area and be a trusted domain expert.

By six months:
- **Domain expertise** — Be the go-to person for a specific area (e.g., evals, datasets, integrations, infrastructure)
- **Shipped projects** — Multiple projects delivered from idea to production
- **Mentorship** — Able to mentor new joiners and review PRs in your area
- **Self-sufficient** — Fully independent in planning, building, and deploying
- **Impact-driven** — Clear sense of how to prioritize for maximum impact

_You're not just contributing — you're shaping how we build and make product decisions._



## Ongoing Support

Throughout your onboarding and beyond, you'll have support from:

- **Max and the team**: Available for prioritization help and technical guidance
- **Pull request reviews**: Continuous feedback on your code
- **Support rotation**: Learn from real user problems and needs
- **Context sharing**: Regular updates on company priorities and strategic direction

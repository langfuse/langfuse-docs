# Roadmapping

## Why do we have a roadmapping process?

- Align on near-term product vision
- Resolve trade-offs between competing proposals
- Be intentional about where we are going
- Commit and be transparent about it with our community

## Process

<Callout type="info">
  All process stages are run in the “Roadmap” Figjam (internal). We run this process once a quarter.
</Callout>

1. Exploration
   - Everyone gathers what they deem most important for the next quarter based on customer conversations, [GitHub Discussions](https://langfuse.com/ideas), and market insight.
   - Everyone is expected to cover this well for their own responsibilities/ownership, but contributions to everything else are welcome.
   - This is an individual process step, but it makes sense to discuss exploration results with colleagues that work on the same or related product areas before the exploration phase is over to refine the thoughts a bit.
2. Aggregation/drafting: Marc aggregates into a single holistic roadmap
3. Comments: everyone reviews draft and adds comments/questions
4. Discussion: teams meet to go through questions and agree on prioritization
5. Share
   - Update [langfuse.com/roadmap](http://langfuse.com/roadmap)
   - Organize community townhall and publish recording on YouTube ([playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4v4zZF1rGG6ICfvehJcDWAnAigSpEcxc))

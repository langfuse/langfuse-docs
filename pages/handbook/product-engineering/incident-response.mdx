# Langfuse Incident Response Plan

---

### On-Call

On-call schedules are managed in **PagerDuty**. Declaring an incident in incident.io triggers a PagerDuty alert — the on-call engineer's phone will ring within 1–2 minutes.

**When to page:** platform outages, security issues, elevated errors, a customer seeing another customer's data. When in doubt, page.

---

### Declaration

**Any team member** can declare an incident at any time. Don't wait for certainty.

1. Log in to **incident.io** (Slack SSO) → **"Declare Incident"**.
2. Fill in a summary, affected service(s), and **always select the highest severity** — this is not published externally. For now we only have high severity incidents.

incident.io will automatically create a **Slack channel**, page the **on-call engineer** via PagerDuty, and post to **#incidents**.

---



### Incident Lead

The **first engineer to join** the incident channel is the Incident Lead. Assign yourself the role in incident.io. Pull respective [DRIs](https://langfuse.com/handbook/how-we-work/ownership) of affected components or Max in if needed. If required, pull someone from the business side in to monitor Slack channels and support tickets.

The Incident Lead owns mitigation, coordinates all system changes, keeps the channel and status page updated, and decides when to adjust severity or dissolve the call.

### Response

1. **Triage** — Join the Slack channel, collect evidence (screenshots, metrics, logs), update [status.langfuse.com](https://status.langfuse.com) via incident.io. For critical incidents, enable the product announcement banner.
2. **Mitigate** — Restore the system first: rollback, scale up, feature-flag, hotfix. Root cause comes later.
3. **Stabilize** — Mark as mitigated in incident.io, update status page, monitor for 15–30 min, then dissolve the call.

---

### Status page

The incident lead makes sure that we always keep the status page up to date with concise and accurate information. The status page is updated via incident.io. The status page is published to [status.langfuse.com](https://status.langfuse.com).

---

### Resolution & Post-Mortem

After mitigation, find and fix the root cause. Complete the post-mortem in [Linear](https://linear.app/langfuse/view/incidents-952de24cfbb8) using the auto-generated timeline, covering: summary, impact, root cause, contributing factors, and action items with owners. Track follow-ups in the Linear ticket. Share in **#team-engineering**.

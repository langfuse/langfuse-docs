4. Support  
   1. Explain that everyone does Support  
   2. Jannik from the team will start routing tickets to you at some point  
   3. You will be responsible to look into these on a daily basis.  
      1. Acknowledge as fast as possible and tell users we look into it  
      2. Look more deeply into issues and resolve same day  
5. Production access:  
   1. Depends on the type of engineer  
   2. Engineers with prod access have lots of power of destroying our infrastructure. Make sure they understand this and only do things carefully.

1. Ask for GH handle
2. Set up all accounts. For this, see (internal documentation)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tOLR8SvU7YY-47SZbpcSu8d5bCoIipE9pOvb8N3Ejcw/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.jeegya3nj7g]
3. Find first small project to work on. This can be a small feature, a small bug fix. Goal: new joiner should merge on first day.

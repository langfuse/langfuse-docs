# Releases

## Release on Langfuse Cloud

We deploy incremental changes to Langfuse Cloud production multiple times per day.

How to release a change:

- Langfuse Cloud: the `production` branch deploys to all Langfuse Cloud regions. We frequently first release changes to Langfuse Cloud this way in order to monitor for potential failures before cutting an OSS release.
- OSS: (see below)

## Release OSS

We cut new releases multiple times per week. We follow semantic versioning.

1. Make sure you are on `main`; run `git status` to make sure that you track `origin:main`.
2. Run `pnpm run release`, this:
   1. Bumps version numbers across packages
   2. Pushes commit to main
   3. Triggers release note on GitHub (please group the changes according to conventional commit type; see previous releases for reference)
3. GitHub Actions will automatically force push this commit to the `production` branch for a deployment to Langfuse Cloud (see above); no additional action necessary.

## New features

When we release a new feature:

- Let customers know who asked for this or shared feedback; if you link Plain threads to Linear issues, they are automatically changed to `close the loop` status when issue is marked as done in Linear (see [product ops](/handbook/product-engineering/how-we-work/product-ops))
- Update the documentation
- Create a changelog post

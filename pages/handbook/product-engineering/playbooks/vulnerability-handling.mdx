# Vulnerability Handling

We have two different processes for handling security reports. These security reports are always triaged by engineers within 24 hours to act on them promptly if needed.

## Process 1: Manual Security Reports

Security reports sent to `security@langfuse.com` are forwarded to Plain.com (our support tool), where an engineer is auto-assigned to triage and create a Linear ticket.

    Email --> Forward["Forward to Plain.com (Support Tool)"]
    Forward --> AutoAssign["Engineer Auto-Assigned"]
    AutoAssign --> Triage["Engineer Triages"]
    Triage --> Linear["Engineer Creates Linear Ticket (Vulnerability Dashboard)"]
```

## Process 2: Automated Vulnerability Detection

All Langfuse repositories have Dependabot and Snyk enabled. Vulnerabilities are automatically reported to GitHub, which sends webhooks to Make.com to create Linear tickets. Automated tickets are auto-assigned to Max.

    end

    Dependabot --> GitHub["GitHub Security Alerts"]
    Snyk --> GitHub

    GitHub --> Make["Webhook to Make.com"]
    Make --> Linear["Linear Ticket<br/>(Vulnerability Dashboard)"]
    Linear --> AutoAssign["Auto-assign to Engineer"]
    AutoAssign --> Engineer["Engineer Triages"]
```

## 24-Hour Policy

All vulnerabilities must be checked and actioned within 24 hours of detection or report.

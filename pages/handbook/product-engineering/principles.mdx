# Product Engineering Principles

## What we do

- Define group of lead users with whom we can iterate more closely on each product area
- Docs are a key
- 1-2 engineers on each core product area
- Act swiftly on customer feedback (bugs, improvements) if core to roadmap/strategy, goal to get them shipped same-week if small, builds trust and compounds
  - Move feedback from Slack/Plain/â€¦ into Linear asap if we want to ship this, thereby we reduce noise in public channels and track execution of improvements
- Be ambitious and focused, continuously ship high-quality product
- Write docs, do support; docs is how we scale, support is how we learn and make sure that customers ping us whenever the product is not as great as it could be

## What we don't do

- Optimize for the requirements of a single user if it does not match our roadmap
- Communicate timelines externally
- Get into high-stress, we are calmly shipping at high velocity, usually there is no need for very short term stress

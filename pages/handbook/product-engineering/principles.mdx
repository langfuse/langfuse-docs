# Product Engineering Principles

## What we do

- Define a group of lead users with whom we can iterate more closely on each product area
- Product areas are clearly split between engineers (see [ownership](/handbook/how-we-work/ownership))
- Write docs, do support
  - Docs are how we scale and a key aspect of the product
  - Support is how we learn and make sure that customers ping us whenever the product is not as great as it could be
- Question/cut scope to ensure quality/speed/maintainability
- Follow the [Product Ops workflow](/handbook/product-engineering/product-ops) to
  - Act swiftly on customer feedback (bugs, improvements) if core to roadmap/strategy; goal to get them shipped same-week if small; builds trust and compounds
  - Move feedback from Slack/Plain/â€¦ into Linear ASAP if we want to ship this, thereby we reduce noise in public channels and track execution of improvements

## What we don't do

- Optimize for the requirements of a single user if it does not match our roadmap
- Communicate timelines externally
- Get into high-stress; we are calmly shipping at high velocity/quality

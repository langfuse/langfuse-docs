# Roadmapping

Why do we have a roadmapping process:

- Align on near-term product vision
- Resolve trade-offs between competing proposals
- Be intentional

Process, run on “Roadmap” Figjam (internal)

- Exploration: everyone gathers what they deem most important for the next quarter based on customer conversations, [GitHub Discussions](https://langfuse.com/ideas), and market insight. Everyone is expected to cover this well for their own responsibilities/ownership, but contributions to everything else are welcome
- Aggregation/drafting: Marc aggregates into a single wholistic roadmap
- Comments: everyone reviews draft and adds comments/questions
- Discussion: teams meet to go through questions and agree on prioritization
- Share
  - Update [langfuse.com/roadmap](http://langfuse.com/roadmap)
  - Organize community townhall and publish recording on YouTube ([playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4v4zZF1rGG6ICfvehJcDWAnAigSpEcxc))

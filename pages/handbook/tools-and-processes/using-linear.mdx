# Using Linear

We use Linear for all internal ticketing / task management.

Linear is the backbone of our [product ops](/handbook/product-engineering/how-we-work/product-ops) that allows us to move fast as a small team while working with a large community of customers and OSS users.

## Principles

- Everyone maintains their own issues and projects
  - We do not have someone on the team that manages the backlog centrally → There should be no issues that are not assigned to someone.
- Create Linear issues for tasks that are likely to happen within the next 6 months. Everything beyond that can be tracked on the [roadmap](/docs/roadmap) and [GitHub ideas](/ideas).

## How to use Linear

- SLA: Clear out Linear Inbox multiple times a day. This is the main on-topic discussion channel.
- Git:
  - When making a change, copy the branch name from Linear issue, which leads to automatic linking of PR to Linear issue.
  - Once PR is merged, issue is moved to the `merged` state. Move to `done` once the change is deployed to production and all potential follow-up work is tracked/done.

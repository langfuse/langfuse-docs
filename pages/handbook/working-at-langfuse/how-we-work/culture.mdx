# Culture

We are an in-office company focused on autonomy and focus (see [principles](/handbook/working-at-langfuse/principles) and [ownership](/handbook/working-at-langfuse/how-we-work/ownership)) to work towards our mission alongside a great team.

## Communication

We mostly communicate async as (1) sync comms should be hardly necessary with enough context and personal responsibility, and (2) it allows us to get lots of work done on a [Maker Schedule](https://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html).

Core channels (in priority order):

1. [Weekly meetings](/handbook/working-at-langfuse/how-we-work/meetings)
2. [Linear Inbox](/handbook/working-at-langfuse/how-we-work/using-linear)
3. Comments on Plain tickets (external)
4. [Slack](/handbook/working-at-langfuse/how-we-work/using-slack)
5. Email
6. Daily lunch with team, chit-chat + sync on what's happening

All these channels are meant to be async and not notifying. Everyone is responsible to maintain their inbox 0 across channels to make async communication work. As teams grow, communications often becomes slow or increasingly synchronous; we do not want this to happen for us.

If something is really urgent, we walk over to the other person or send a DM / call.

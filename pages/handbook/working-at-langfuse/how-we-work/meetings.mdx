# Meetings

We have a small number of regular meetings. Generally, standing meetings are an anti-pattern at Langfuse and most things are better resolved adhoc/async.

## Regular Meetings

### Weekly Meetings

1.  Mondays: Week Ahead (15 min, full team), What do I want to get done this week?
    - Everyone has 1 minute. Be prepared to be specific about the major work items
    - Goal
      - Help everyone with accountability/focus for the week
      - Identify dependencies and create opportunities for others to make quick suggestions / share context that is not yet known
2.  Fridays: Demo (1h, full team), What did I get done this week?
    - Everyone has 4-5 minutes. Usually this involves screensharing, but can also be a verbal summary.
    - Goal: celebrate wins, share context of what is going on and interesting findings

### Bi-monthly

- Team Retro (1h, full team, often during lunch/dinner)
  - Goal: increase our effectiveness as a team
  - Everyone prepared 0-3 start/continue/stop items, Figjam board shared ahead of the session in `#team-async`

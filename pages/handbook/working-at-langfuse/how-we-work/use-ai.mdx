# How do we use AI as a team?

We build a team of strong ICs who are autonomous and highly leveraged with AI. It allows us to move (1) faster as individuals and (2) to automate processes that otherwise would require hiring someone to do it.

1. Personal productivity: Everyone is free to [spend](/handbook/working-at-langfuse/spending-money) on their favorite AI tools for personal productivity. If unsure, ask the founders. â†’ List of tools: [personal productivity](/handbook/working-at-langfuse/how-we-work/personal-productivity) at Langfuse
2. Process automation:
   - AI vendors: We generally prefer to use external vendors as this is usually more cost-effective than maintaining the process ourselves. Examples: [Ask AI](/ask-ai) on langfuse.com is powered by Inkeep; PR code review is powered by Ellipsis and Greptile
   - Internally built tools:
     - Code: You can use our company OpenAI/Anthropic accounts
     - Dogfood Langfuse

# Using Plain

This guide outlines our process for handling support requests at Langfuse. For this, we use [Plain](https://app.plain.com/) ([docs](https://www.plain.com/docs)):

- Centralize our [support channels](/support) in a single inbox
- Manage escalation levels and track SLAs
- Link customer requests and reported bugs to Linear issues

Everyone gets access to Plain during onboarding.

## What is the Process in Plain?

1. **Unified inbox**: Plain is synced with our [support channels](/support): **Slack** Connect channels, **Email** support addresses, **GitHub Discussions** (Support and Ideas) and **In-App Support Form**. Plain uses AI to merge messages into support tickets in case a user uses multiple messages for a single request.
2. **1st Level support:** Screens the inbox regularly, answers questions
   - Assign 2nd level [owner](/handbook/working-at-langfuse/how-we-work/ownership) if escalation is needed
   - Generally, escalate bug reports and feature requests to owner. Owner takes care of linking to their linear backlog (see [product ops](/handbook/product-engineering/product-ops)).
3. **Owner (engineer, gtm)**: fixes/logs the issue, notes feedback, and gives technical advice.
4. **Close the loop:** Resolve immediately or log an issue and ping the user once fixed \+ Update docs

## How to use Plain?

### Personal workflow

- If you are not on first-level support duty
  - You can focus on `Your Threads`.
  - It is expected that you clear these out at least once a day.

1. Status of a Thread.
2. Assignee of a Thread. You own the thread if you are assigned.
3. Customer Tier: Check if they are paying us.
4. Link a linear ticket. Once the Linear ticket is done, the Plain status changes to "Close the Loop" to follow up with the user.
5. User Information: Use this to look up the user project via [Metabase](https://langfuse.metabaseapp.com/dashboard/20-customer-success-lookup).
6. Leave internal notes and tag people.
7. Use plain to directly reply in Slack/Email/ChatWidget
8. Jump to the Slack thread (if it exists)

### Recommended Notification Settings

- [Plain Email Notifications](https://app.plain.com/workspace/w_01JRFXKJD7T2CNACCFAH299XT1/settings/personal/notifications/email/)
  - Disable all except for `@mention on notes` as these are otherwise very difficult to keep track of
- [Plain Slack Notifications](https://app.plain.com/workspace/w_01JRFXKJD7T2CNACCFAH299XT1/settings/personal/notifications/slack/)
  - Subscribe to all events related to threads assigned to you
  - In general, we use Slack async. For most members of the team, making Plain notifications in Slack notifying is the recommended default in order to move fast on customer communication.
- If you are on PTO, please turn on `Away Mode` in order to (1) unassign threads upon new responses from you, (2) disable any automation that auto-assigns tickets to you

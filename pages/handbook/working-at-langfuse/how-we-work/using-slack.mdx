# Using Slack

We use Slack for internal comms and to chat with customers, partners, and vendors. When joining the team, you can sign up for Slack (`langfuse.slack.com`) via your Google account.

We use Slack mostly asynchronously to reduce noise and allow everyone to focus on their own work. If you need something urgent, just walk over to the other person or send a DM/call.

## Suggested configuration

- Enable notifications only for mentions and direct messages and the sync/notifying channels mentioned below.
- Set up `queue-<name>-x-<name>` private channels to send non-notifying messages to colleagues. SLA to respond within 24 hours.
- Set up `All unreads` in the main menu in order to quickly get through the backlog of unread messages.

## External channels

For some prioritized customer groups, we use shared Slack Connect channels for support and sales.

### Sync to Plain

We use the following prefixes for channels

- customers: `ext-` (synced in plain.com, plain app joins automatically)
- partners: `partner-` (**not** synced in plain.com)
- vendors: `vendor-` (**not** synced in plain.com)

All support/sales communication in `ext-*` channels happens via Plain.

### Create new external Slack connect channel

- Create them from the channel group (e.g., `Support batch n`); this allows for easy channel management
- Shared channels should be public channels as this allows for discovery within the customer's Slack organization
- When creating a channel:
  - Invite external members
  - Do not invite any additional Langfuse members
  - Optionally: Mute channel right away if this is ongoing support and not an active deal

### Configure Slack for external channels

- For most channels and most team members: you can mute or leave the existing `ext-*` channels. You will get assigned to threads via Plain.
- For high-value accounts, the person managing the relationship should stay in the channel as this makes it easier to outbound engage the customer â†’ use direct channel to our advantage

### How to mute groups of channels

To quickly tidy up your Slack notifications, you can mute all channels within the support groups at once. Right-click on the channel group in the Slack sidebar, select `Manage`, and then `Mute all`.

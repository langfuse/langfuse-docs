# Using Slack

We use Slack for internal comms and to chat with customers, partners, and vendors. When joining the team, you can sign up for Slack (`langfuse.slack.com`) via your Google account.

We use Slack mostly asynchronously to reduce noise and allow everyone to focus on their own work. If you need something urgent, just walk over to the other person or send a DM / call.

## Suggested configuration

- Enable notifications only for mentions and direct messages and the sync/notifying channels mentioned below.
- Set up `queue-<name>-x-<name>` private channels to send non-notifying messages to colleagues. SLA to respond within 24 hours.
- Set up `All unreads` in the main menu in order to quickly get through the backlog of unread messages.

## Most important channels

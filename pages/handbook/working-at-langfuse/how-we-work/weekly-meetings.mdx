# Weekly Meetings

We are in-office and have 2 weekly meetings as a team.

- Monday Week Ahead (15min, full team): What do I want to get done this week?
- Friday Demo (1h, full team): What did I get done this week? Intention: celebrate wins, share context of what is going on and interesting findings

Other than this:

- Quarterly cadence: Roadmap Planning (needs link)
- No scheduled meetings, everything else is ad hoc when needed (see Engineering Workflow)

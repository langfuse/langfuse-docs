# Weekly Meetings

We are in-office and have 2 weekly meetings as a team. The focus is on creating enough alignment to get lots of work done on a [Maker Schedule](https://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html).

Beyond these planned meetings, everything else is adhoc when needed.

## Mondays: Week Ahead (15 min, full team)

> What do I want to get done this week?

- Everyone has 1 minute. Be prepared to be specific about the major work items
- Goal
  - Help everyone with accountability/focus for the week
  - Identify dependencies and create opportunities for others to make quick suggestions / share context that is not yet known

## Fridays: Demo (1h, full team)

> What did I get done this week?

- Everyone has 4-5 minutes. Usually this involves screensharing, but can also be a verbal summary.
- Goal: celebrate wins, share context of what is going on and interesting findings

## Other meetings

- Quarterly cadence: [Roadmap Planning](/handbook/product-engineering/roadmapping)

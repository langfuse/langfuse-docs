# Principles & Culture

High-level principles:

- “Wide company with small teams/ICs” that self-sufficiently optimize for their goals
- High talent density
- Use AI to the max to scale our work without having to hire more people
- Community first, lean into Open Source
- We are all still early, we lean into value creation
- Care about product and customers; if one person complaints, there are 20x more who face the same issue
- Focus on what is core to our value creation/product, everything else is secondary and can be outsourced / does not need to be perfect
- We are an in-office company

## What influences our principles?

- No Rules Rules by Reed Hastings

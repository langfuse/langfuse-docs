# Spending money

<Callout type="info">
  Only applies if you are an employee of Langfuse GmbH
</Callout>

You can expense things you need for work. Don't worry about it if it's a small one time purchase (sub EUR 100) or a small recurring purchase (sub EUR 50). If it's larger, it is useful to check with the founders.

You will receive a `Pleo card` when you join Langfuse. Pleo is a spend management tool.

## Using Pleo

- For us to be able to claim VAT back in Germany (and for proper accounting) **we need invoices for everything you pay for & they need to comply with following**:
  - be addressed to our company (Langfuse GmbH, see [imprint](/imprint))
  - include our VAT ID (DE358330767) if it is a cross-border transaction
- Reimbursements & Invoice payments: You can get purchases made for the company with your private cards/money reimbursed via Pleo. You are required to submit an invoice via Pleo in order to request this.

## Software Subscriptions

If you need software for work, put it on your Pleo Card.

Please cancel subscriptions that you no longer use.

Many things change rapidly, paying for optionality is often worth it (i.e. go for monthly plans even when the annual is 10-20% cheaper).

We like self-serve software, reduces operational overhead of renewals / negotiations.

## Travel

Please use your Pleo Card to book travel & pay for reasonable expenses.

Again, you will need to have receipts for everything - have them be addressed to the company if possible (e.g. on a hotel bill - yes - if you buy lunch - it doesn't matter).

We only cover economy travel. Please use your discretion & common sense when making purchases with company money.

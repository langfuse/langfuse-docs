# Spending money

> Only applies if you are an employee of Langfuse GmbH

## Expenses

You can expense things you need for work. Don't worry about it if it's a small one time purchase (sub EUR 100) or a small recurring purchase (sub EUR 50). If it's larger, it is useful to check with the founders.

## Pleo

You will receive a Pleo card when you join Langfuse. Pleo is a spend management tool.

- For us to be able to claim VAT back in Germany (and for proper accounting) we need invoices for **everything** you pay for & they need to be addressed to our company (Langfuse GmbH, see [imprint](/imprint))
- They need to include our VAT ID (DE358330767) if it is a cross-border transaction.

## Travel

Please use your Pleo Card to book travel & pay for reasonable expenses.

Again, you will need to have receipts for everything - have them be addressed to the company if possible (e.g. on a hotel bill - yes - if you buy lunch - it doesn't matter).

We only cover economy travel. Please use your discretion & common sense when making purchases with company money.

## Reimbursements & Invoice payments

You can get purchases made for the company with your private cards/money reimbursed via Pleo. You can similarly also hand in invoices that need to be paid via bank transfer in Pleo.

# Time off

You can take PTO as needed.

Please make your manager and the people you work with aware a few weeks in advance for longer (>3 days) absences. It's your responsibility to make sure that people know you won't be there and that responsibilities are covered/distributed.

Please also let the company know in our all-hands stand-ups if you will be gone. Changing your status in Slack and adding OOO to your calendar is expected.

# Mixpanel Integration

[Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com) is a popular choice for product analytics. While Langfuse offers [metrics](/docs/metrics/overview) out of the box, many of our users have asked for a way to **integrate their LLM related metrics that they capture with Langfuse into their Mixpanel dashboards**.

We've built an integration to make it easy to answer questions like:

- _"Are my most active users also the ones who are most engaged with my LLM content?"_
- _"Does interacting with the LLM feature relate to higher retention rates?"_
- _"How does the LLM feature impact my conversion rates?"_
- _"Does the user feedback that I capture in Langfuse correlate with the user behavior that I see in Mixpanel?"_

## Get started

<Steps>

### Enable the integration

Configure this integration in your Langfuse project settings. You will need to select your Mixpanel region and provide your Mixpanel Project Token.

**Available Regions:**

- US (api.mixpanel.com)
- EU (api-eu.mixpanel.com)
- India (api-in.mixpanel.com)

You can find your Project Token in your Mixpanel project settings under "Project Settings" > "Project Token".

### Initial sync

Once integrated, Langfuse will sync all historical data from your project to Mixpanel. After the initial sync, new data is automatically synced every hour (with a 30-minute delay) to keep your Mixpanel dashboards up to date.

### Build a dashboard in Mixpanel

Once integrated, you can build dashboards in Mixpanel to visualize your Langfuse metrics (see [reference below](#details)).

</Steps>

## Integration details [#details]

On an hourly schedule, Langfuse batches aggregated events and metrics to your Mixpanel instance.

### Metadata matching

Matching of metadata helps to join the data from Langfuse with the data from Mixpanel:

| Langfuse                                                      | Mixpanel                  | Notes                                                                                                                       |

| `trace.timestamp`, `generation.started_at`, `score.timestamp` | `time`                    | Sent as milliseconds since epoch                                                                                            |
| `trace.metadata.$mixpanel_session_id`                         | `session_id`              | Optional, you need to add the Mixpanel session id to your Langfuse trace [metadata](/docs/observability/features/metadata). |

## Troubleshooting

**Missing data in Mixpanel?** Please check that you have correctly selected the Mixpanel region and entered the Project Token in your Langfuse project settings. The integration syncs data every hour with a 30-minute delay, so there may be a short lag before new events appear. Reach out to us if you encounter any other issues with the integration.

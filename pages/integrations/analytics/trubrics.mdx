# Trubrics Integration

The Trubrics integration allows you to import your Langfuse LLM tracing data directly into Trubrics for unified analytics and insights.

## Setup

1. Navigate to the Integrations section in your Trubrics project
2. Provide your Langfuse credentials:
   - Langfuse API Key
   - Langfuse Secret Key
   - Langfuse Host URL (defaults to https://cloud.langfuse.com)

## How It Works

- The integration automatically fetches trace data from your Langfuse account
- Traces are mapped to Trubrics events using configurable mapping rules
- Standard events like "User Prompt" and "LLM Generation" are automatically detected
- All events include a direct link back to the original trace in Langfuse

## Advanced Configuration

Advanced users can customize the mapping rules to fine-tune how Langfuse data is imported into Trubrics, allowing for tailored analytics and insights.

For more details about the automated integration with mapping rules, visit the [Trubrics documentation](https://docs.trubrics.com/track_events/integrations/langfuse/).

    "This notebook demonstrates how to integrate **Langfuse** with **LangChain DeepAgents**. By the end of this notebook, you will be able to trace your DeepAgents applications with Langfuse for improved observability and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What are LangChain DeepAgents?** [DeepAgents](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents) is a framework for building autonomous AI agents that can perform deep research and complex tasks. Built on LangChain, DeepAgents provides tools for creating agents that can plan, research, critique, and iterate on their outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What is Langfuse?** [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is an open-source LLM engineering platform. It provides tracing and monitoring capabilities for LLM applications, helping developers debug, analyze, and optimize their AI systems. Langfuse integrates with various tools and frameworks via native integrations, OpenTelemetry, and API/SDKs.\n",

    "4/ comparison between A and B\n",

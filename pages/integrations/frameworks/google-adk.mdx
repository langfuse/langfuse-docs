# Integrate Langfuse with Google's Agent Development Kit

This notebook demonstrates how to capture detailed traces from a [Google Agent Development Kit](https://github.com/google/adk-python) (ADK) application with **[Langfuse](https://langfuse.com)** using the OpenTelemetry (OTel) protocol.

> **Why Agent Development Kit?**  
> [Google’s Agent Development Kit](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/agent-development-kit-easy-to-build-multi-agent-applications/) streamlines building, orchestrating, and tracing generative-AI agents out of the box, letting you move from prototype to production far faster than wiring everything yourself.

> **Why Langfuse?**  
> [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) gives you a detailed dashboard and rich analytics for every prompt, model response, and function call in your agent, making it easy to debug, evaluate, and iterate on LLM apps.

<Steps>
## Step&nbsp;1: Install dependencies


```python
%pip install langfuse google-adk openinference-instrumentation-google-adk -q
```

## Step 2: Set up environment variables

Fill in the **Langfuse** and your **Gemini API key**.


```python
import os

# Get keys for your project from the project settings page: https://cloud.langfuse.com
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇪🇺 EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇺🇸 US region

# Gemini API Key (Get from Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "..." 
```

With the environment variables set, we can now initialize the Langfuse client. `get_client()` initializes the Langfuse client using the credentials provided in the environment variables.


```python
from langfuse import get_client
 
langfuse = get_client()
 
# Verify connection
if langfuse.auth_check():
    print("Langfuse client is authenticated and ready!")
else:
    print("Authentication failed. Please check your credentials and host.")
```

    Langfuse client is authenticated and ready!


## Step 3: OpenTelemetry Instrumentation

Use the [`GoogleADKInstrumentor`](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference/tree/main/python/instrumentation/openinference-instrumentation-google-adk) library to wrap ADK calls and send OpenTelemetry spans to Langfuse.


```python
from openinference.instrumentation.google_adk import GoogleADKInstrumentor

GoogleADKInstrumentor().instrument()
```

## Step 3: Build a hello world agent

Every tool call and model completion is captured as an OpenTelemetry span and forwarded to Langfuse.


```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.runners import Runner
from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService
from google.genai import types

def say_hello():
    return {"greeting": "Hello Langfuse 👋"}

agent = Agent(
    name="hello_agent",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    instruction="Always greet using the say_hello tool.",
    tools=[say_hello],
)

APP_NAME = "hello_app"
USER_ID = "demo-user"
SESSION_ID = "demo-session"

session_service = InMemorySessionService()
# create_session is async → await it in notebooks
await session_service.create_session(app_name=APP_NAME, user_id=USER_ID, session_id=SESSION_ID)

runner = Runner(agent=agent, app_name=APP_NAME, session_service=session_service)

user_msg = types.Content(role="user", parts=[types.Part(text="hi")])
for event in runner.run(user_id=USER_ID, session_id=SESSION_ID, new_message=user_msg):
    if event.is_final_response():
        print(event.content.parts[0].text)
```

## Step 4: View the trace in Langfuse

Head over to your **Langfuse dashboard → Traces**. You should see traces including all tool calls and model inputs/outputs.

# Trace the OpenAI Agents SDK with Langfuse

This notebook demonstrates how to **integrate Langfuse** into your **OpenAI Agents** workflow to monitor, debug and evaluate your AI agents.

> **What is the OpenAI Agents SDK?**: The [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/) is a lightweight, open-source framework that lets developers build AI agents and orchestrate multi-agent workflows. It provides building blocks—such as tools, handoffs, and guardrails to configure large language models with custom instructions and integrated tools. Its Python-first design supports dynamic instructions and function tools for rapid prototyping and integration with external systems.

> **What is Langfuse?**: [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) is an open-source observability platform for AI agents. It helps you visualize and monitor LLM calls, tool usage, cost, latency, and more.

## 1. Install Dependencies

Below we install the `openai-agents` library (the OpenAI Agents SDK), and the [OpenInference OpenAI Agents instrumentation](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference/tree/main/python/instrumentation/openinference-instrumentation-openai-agents) library.


```python
%pip install openai-agents langfuse nest_asyncio openinference-instrumentation-openai-agents
```

## 2. Configure Environment & Langfuse Credentials

Next, set up your Langfuse API keys. You can get these keys by signing up for a free [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com/) account or by [self-hosting Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting). These environment variables are essential for the Langfuse client to authenticate and send data to your Langfuse project.


```python
import os

# Get keys for your project from the project settings page: https://cloud.langfuse.com
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇪🇺 EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇺🇸 US region

# Your openai key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-proj-..."
```

## 3. Instrumenting the Agent


```python
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()
```

Now, we initialize the [OpenInference OpenAI Agents instrumentation](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference/tree/main/python/instrumentation/openinference-instrumentation-openai-agents). This third-party instrumentation automatically captures OpenAI Agents operations and exports OpenTelemetry (OTel) spans to Langfuse.


```python
from openinference.instrumentation.openai_agents import OpenAIAgentsInstrumentor

OpenAIAgentsInstrumentor().instrument()
```

Now initialize the Langfuse client. `get_client()` initializes the Langfuse client using the credentials provided in the environment variables.


```python
from langfuse import get_client
 
langfuse = get_client()
 
# Verify connection
if langfuse.auth_check():
    print("Langfuse client is authenticated and ready!")
else:
    print("Authentication failed. Please check your credentials and host.")
```

## 4. Hello World Example

Below we create an **OpenAI Agent** that always replies in **haiku** form. We run it with `Runner.run` and print the final output.



```python
import asyncio
from agents import Agent, Runner

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        name="Assistant",
        instructions="You only respond in haikus.",
    )

    result = await Runner.run(agent, "Tell me about recursion in programming.")
    print(result.final_output)

loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
await loop.create_task(main())
```

![Example trace in Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/images/cookbook/integration_openai-agents/openai-agent-example-trace.png)

**Example**: [Langfuse Trace](https://cloud.langfuse.com/project/cloramnkj0002jz088vzn1ja4/traces/483a2afb22b41ee49d7d1e5b41b4967a?timestamp=2025-09-30T09%3A01%3A29.194Z&observation=e3e3580728f3fec4)

Clicking the link above (or your own project link) lets you view all sub-spans, token usage, latencies, etc., for debugging or optimization.

## 5. Multi-agent Handoff Example

Here we create:
- A **Spanish agent** that responds only in Spanish.
- An **English agent** that responds only in English.
- A **Triage agent** that routes the request to the correct agent based on the input language.

Any calls or handoffs are captured as part of the trace. That way, you can see which sub-agent or tool was used, as well as the final result.


```python
from agents import Agent, Runner
import asyncio

spanish_agent = Agent(
    name="Spanish agent",
    instructions="You only speak Spanish.",
)

english_agent = Agent(
    name="English agent",
    instructions="You only speak English",
)

triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage agent",
    instructions="Handoff to the appropriate agent based on the language of the request.",
    handoffs=[spanish_agent, english_agent],
)

result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, input="Hola, ¿cómo estás?")
print(result.final_output)
```

![Example trace in Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/images/cookbook/integration_openai-agents/openai-agent-example-trace-handoff.png)

**Example**: [Langfuse Trace](https://cloud.langfuse.com/project/cloramnkj0002jz088vzn1ja4/traces/c376e44920527b875add9d97b4ed9312?observation=94a1dc00d7067ae8&timestamp=2025-09-30T09%3A03%3A51.191Z)

## 6. Functions Example

The OpenAI Agents SDK allows the agent to call Python functions. With Langfuse instrumentation, you can see which **functions** are called, their arguments, and the return values. Here we define a simple function `get_weather(city: str)` and add it as a tool.



```python
import asyncio
from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool

# Example function tool.
@function_tool
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    return f"The weather in {city} is sunny."

agent = Agent(
    name="Hello world",
    instructions="You are a helpful agent.",
    tools=[get_weather],
)

async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(agent, input="What's the weather in Tokyo?")
    print(result.final_output)

loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
await loop.create_task(main())
```

![Example trace in Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/images/cookbook/integration_openai-agents/openai-agent-example-trace-function.png)

**Example**: [Langfuse Trace](https://cloud.langfuse.com/project/cloramnkj0002jz088vzn1ja4/traces/fee618f96dc31e0ca38b2f7b26eb8b29?timestamp=2025-09-30T09%3A03%3A59.962Z&observation=5b99c3e3411ed17b)

When viewing the trace, you’ll see a span capturing the function call `get_weather` and the arguments passed.

## 7. Grouping Agent Runs

In some workflows, you want to group multiple calls into a single trace—for instance, when building a small chain of prompts that all relate to the same user request. You can use a `trace(...)` context manager to nest multiple calls under one top-level trace.



```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, trace
import asyncio

async def main():
    agent = Agent(name="Joke generator", instructions="Tell funny jokes.")

    with trace("Joke workflow"):
        first_result = await Runner.run(agent, "Tell me a joke")
        second_result = await Runner.run(agent, f"Rate this joke: {first_result.final_output}")
        print(f"Joke: {first_result.final_output}")
        print(f"Rating: {second_result.final_output}")

loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
await loop.create_task(main())
```

![Example trace in Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/images/cookbook/integration_openai-agents/openai-agent-example-trace-grouped.png)

**Example**: [Langfuse Trace](https://cloud.langfuse.com/project/cloramnkj0002jz088vzn1ja4/traces/afa1ae379b6c3a5333e2bab357f31cdc?timestamp=2025-09-30T09%3A04%3A06.678Z&observation=496efdc060a5399b)

Each child call is represented as a sub-span under the top-level **Joke workflow** span, making it easy to see the entire conversation or sequence of calls.

## Link Langfuse Prompt

If you manage your prompt with [Langfuse Prompt Management](https://langfuse.com/docs/prompt-management/overview), you can link the used prompt to the trace by setting up an OTel Span processor.

<Callout type="info" emoji="⚠️">
**Limitation:** This method links the Langfuse Prompt to all generation spans in the trace that start with the defined string (see next cell).
</Callout>


```python
from contextvars import ContextVar
from typing import Optional
from opentelemetry import context as context_api, trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import Span, SpanProcessor

prompt_info_var = ContextVar("prompt_info", default=None)

# Make sure to set the name of the generation spans in your trace
class LangfuseProcessor(SpanProcessor):
    def on_start(self, span: "Span", parent_context: Optional[context_api.Context] = None) -> None:
        if span.name.startswith("response"): # The name of the generation spans in your trace 
            prompt_info = prompt_info_var.get()
            if prompt_info:
                span.set_attribute("langfuse.prompt.name", prompt_info.get("name"))
                span.set_attribute("langfuse.prompt.version", prompt_info.get("version"))


# 1) Register your processor BEFORE instantiating Langfuse
trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(LangfuseProcessor())

# 2) Now bring up Langfuse (it will attach its own span processor/exporter to the same provider)
from langfuse import Langfuse, get_client
langfuse = get_client()
```


```python
from openinference.instrumentation.openai_agents import OpenAIAgentsInstrumentor

OpenAIAgentsInstrumentor().instrument()
```


```python
# Fetch the prompt from Langfuse Prompt Management
langfuse_prompt = langfuse.get_prompt("movie-critic")
system_prompt = langfuse_prompt.compile(criticlevel = "expert", movie = "Dune 2")

# Pass the prompt to the SpanProcessor
prompt_info_var.set({
    "name": langfuse_prompt.name,
    "version": langfuse_prompt.version,
})

# Run the agent ...
```

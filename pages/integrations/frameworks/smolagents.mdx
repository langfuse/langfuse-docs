# Integrate Langfuse with smolagents

This notebook shows how to monitor and debug your Hugging Face **smolagents** with **Langfuse** using the `SmolagentsInstrumentor`. By the end of this guide, you will be able to trace your smolagents applications with Langfuse.

> **What are smolagents?** [smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) is a minimalist and open-source AI agent framework developed by Hugging Face, designed to simplify the creation and deployment of powerful agents with just a few lines of code. It focuses on simplicity and efficiency, making it easy for developers to leverage LLMs for various applications.

> **What is Langfuse?** [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is an open-source platform for LLM engineering. It provides tracing and monitoring capabilities for AI agents, helping developers debug, analyze, and optimize their products. Langfuse integrates with various tools and frameworks via native integrations, OpenTelemetry, and SDKs.

## Get Started

We'll walk through a simple example of using smolagents and integrating it with Langfuse.

<Steps>
### Step 1: Install Dependencies


```python
%pip install langfuse 'smolagents[telemetry]' opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp openinference-instrumentation-smolagents
```

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

Get your Langfuse API keys by signing up for [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com) or [self-hosting Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting).

Also, add your [Hugging Face token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) (`HF_TOKEN`) as an environment variable.



```python
import os
# Get keys for your project from the project settings page: https://cloud.langfuse.com
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇪🇺 EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇺🇸 US region

# your Hugging Face token
os.environ["HF_TOKEN"] = "hf_..."
```

With the environment variables set, we can now initialize the Langfuse client. `get_client()` initializes the Langfuse client using the credentials provided in the environment variables.


```python
from langfuse import get_client
 
langfuse = get_client()
 
# Verify connection
if langfuse.auth_check():
    print("Langfuse client is authenticated and ready!")
else:
    print("Authentication failed. Please check your credentials and host.")
```

    Langfuse client is authenticated and ready!


### Step 3: Initialize the `SmolagentsInstrumentor`

Initialize the `[SmolagentsInstrumentor](https://pypi.org/project/openinference-instrumentation-smolagents/)` before your application code.


```python
from openinference.instrumentation.smolagents import SmolagentsInstrumentor

SmolagentsInstrumentor().instrument()
```

### Step 4: Run your smolagent

This smolagent example has a manager `CodeAgent` that orchestrates the `managed_agent`, which can perform web searches to gather data. By using tools like `DuckDuckGoSearchTool` and `VisitWebpageTool`, it retrieves the U.S. 2024 growth rate and calculates how many years it will take for the GDP to double.



```python
from smolagents import (
    CodeAgent,
    ToolCallingAgent,
    DuckDuckGoSearchTool,
    VisitWebpageTool,
    HfApiModel,
)

model = HfApiModel(
    model_id="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B"
)

search_agent = ToolCallingAgent(
    tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool(), VisitWebpageTool()],
    model=model,
    name="search_agent",
    description="This is an agent that can do web search.",
)

manager_agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[],
    model=model,
    managed_agents=[search_agent],
)
manager_agent.run(
    "How can Langfuse be used to monitor and improve the reasoning and decision-making of smolagents when they execute multi-step tasks, like dynamically adjusting a recipe based on user feedback or available ingredients?"
)
```

### Step 5: View Traces in Langfuse

After running the agent, you can view the traces generated by your smolagents application in [Langfuse](https://cloud.langfuse.com). You should see detailed steps of the LLM interactions, which can help you debug and optimize your AI agent.

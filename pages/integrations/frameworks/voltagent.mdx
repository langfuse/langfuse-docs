# Observability for VoltAgent with Langfuse

This guide shows you how to integrate **Langfuse** with **VoltAgent** for observability and tracing. By following these steps, you'll be able to monitor and debug your VoltAgent agents in the Langfuse dashboard.

> **What is VoltAgent?** [VoltAgent](https://github.com/voltagent/voltagent) is an open-source TypeScript framework that acts as this essential toolkit. It simplifies the development of AI agent applications by providing modular building blocks, standardized patterns, and abstractions. Whether you're creating chatbots, virtual assistants, automated workflows, or complex multi-agent systems, VoltAgent handles the underlying complexity, allowing you to focus on defining your agents' capabilities and logic.

## Integration

<Steps>

### Create a VoltAgent project

If you don't have a VoltAgent project yet, you can create one using the VoltAgent CLI:

```bash
npm create voltagent-app@latest
```

Move into the project directory:

```bash
cd my-voltagent-app
```

You can get the full VoltAgent installation instructions [here](https://voltagent.dev/docs/quick-start/)

### Set up Langfuse project

Create a project in [Langfuse](https://cloud.langfuse.com) and get your API keys from the project settings page.

### Add environment variables

Create or update your `.env.development` file with the following variables:

```bash
# Your LLM API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Langfuse credentials
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-...
LANGFUSE_HOST=https://cloud.langfuse.com # Optional. Defaults to https://cloud.langfuse.com
```

### Install the `@voltagent/langfuse-exporter` package

Add the `@voltagent/langfuse-exporter` package to your project:

```bash
npm install @voltagent/langfuse-exporter
```

### Configure Langfuse Exporter

Modify your main application file (e.g., `index.ts` where `VoltAgent` is initialized) to import `LangfuseExporter` and configure it within the `VoltAgent` options:

```typescript
import { VoltAgent, Agent } from "@voltagent/core";
import { VercelAIProvider } from "@voltagent/vercel-ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

import { LangfuseExporter } from "@voltagent/langfuse-exporter";

const langfuseExporter = new LangfuseExporter({
  publicKey: process.env.LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY,
  secretKey: process.env.LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY,
  baseUrl: process.env.LANGFUSE_HOST,
});

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "my-voltagent-app",
  description: "A helpful assistant that answers questions without using tools",
  llm: new VercelAIProvider(),
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
});

new VoltAgent({
  agents: {
    agent,
  },
  telemetryExporter: langfuseExporter,
});
```

<Callout type="info">

Ensure your agent definition (`new Agent({...})`) and the `VoltAgent` instantiation (`new VoltAgent({...})`) match your project structure. The key change is adding the `LangfuseExporter` and the `telemetryExporter` option.

</Callout>

### Run your VoltAgent application

Start the VoltAgent development server or run your application as usual:

```bash
npm run dev
```

When you run the `dev` command, `tsx` will compile and run your code. You should see the VoltAgent server startup message in your terminal:

```bash
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
  VOLTAGENT SERVER STARTED SUCCESSFULLY
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
  ✓ HTTP Server: http://localhost:3141

  Developer Console:    https://console.voltagent.dev
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
[VoltAgent] All packages are up to date
```

Your agent is now running! To interact with it:

1.  **Open the Console:** Click the [`https://console.voltagent.dev`](https://console.voltagent.dev) link in your terminal output (or copy-paste it into your browser).
2.  **Find Your Agent:** On the VoltAgent Console page, you should see your agent listed (e.g., "my-agent").
3.  **Open Agent Details:** Click on your agent's name.
4.  **Start Chatting:** On the agent detail page, click the chat icon in the bottom right corner to open the chat window.
5.  **Send a Message:** Type a message like "Hello" and press Enter.

### View traces in Langfuse

Head over to your [Langfuse dashboard](https://cloud.langfuse.com) and you'll see the traces from your agent interactions. You can analyze the prompts, completions, and other details of your AI interactions.

Here's an example of a trace:

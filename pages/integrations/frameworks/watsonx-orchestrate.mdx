# IBM watsonx Orchestrate

Monitor agents and tools built with IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK in Langfuse. Orchestrate has a native integration that forwards telemetry (traces, spans, logs) to Langfuse for rich observability.

> **What is IBM watsonx Orchestrate?** [IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK](https://developer.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com/) is a framework that lets developers build and publish custom skills (actions) that watsonx Orchestrate can execute within automated workflows.

> **What is Langfuse?** [Langfuse](/) is a platform for monitoring, debugging, and analyzing your AI applications. It provides a set of tools and services to help you monitor, debug, and analyze your AI applications.

## Prerequisites

- Langfuse Cloud (`https://cloud.langfuse.com`) or a self-hosted Langfuse instance
- IBM watsonx Orchestrate ADK installed

## Quick start (CLI)

Configure Orchestrate to send telemetry to Langfuse. Replace placeholders with your values.

```bash
orchestrate settings observability langfuse configure \
  --url "https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/otel" \
  --api-key "sk-lf-0000-0000-0000-0000-0000" \
  --health-uri "https://cloud.langfuse.com" \
  --config-json '{"public_key": "pk-lf-0000-0000-0000-0000-0000"}'
```

<Callout type="info">
- For self-hosted Langfuse, set `--url` to `https://<your-langfuse-host>/api/public/otel` and `--health-uri` to `https://<your-langfuse-host>`.
- You can also provide `--project-id` (or `-p`) if not part of the config file.
</Callout>

## Alternative: YAML config file

Create a YAML file and reference it from the CLI. Example:

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: langfuse
project_id: default
api_key: sk-lf-00000-00000-00000-00000-00000
url: https://cloud.langfuse.com/api/public/otel
host_health_uri: https://cloud.langfuse.com
config_json:
  public_key: pk-lf-00000-00000-00000-00000-00000
  mask_pii: true
```

Apply it:

```bash
orchestrate settings observability langfuse configure --config-file=path_to_file.yml
```

## Enable telemetry in Orchestrate

To enable IBM's native observability framework, start the Orchestrate server with the `--with-ibm-telemetry` or `-i` flag, then go to `https://localhost:8765` in your browser.

Start the Orchestrate server with telemetry enabled, then open the local console:

```bash
orchestrate start --with-ibm-telemetry
# or shorthand
orchestrate start -i

# Open the console
# https://localhost:8765
```

## Troubleshooting

- Connection/health: Ensure `--health-uri` responds and the ingest URL points to `/api/public/otel`
- Auth: Verify the `api_key` (Secret Key) and `public_key` (Public Key) belong to the same Langfuse project
- Self-hosted: Confirm your Langfuse instance is reachable from Orchestrate and TLS is configured correctly

# Integrations

Langfuse is designed to be the most open and flexible platform for LLM engineering that integrates with all the major LLM providers, frameworks, and tools.
See a full list of integrations below.

Langfuse is based on OpenTelemetry. Use the Python SDK or JS/TS SDK to log traces to Langfuse. Alternatively, you can also directly use our OpenTelemetry Endpoint from any language.

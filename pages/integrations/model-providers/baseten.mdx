# Observability for Baseten with Langfuse


This guide shows you how to integrate [Baseten](https://www.baseten.co/) with Langfuse. Baseten's inference API is fully compatible with OpenAI's client libraries, allowing us to use the Langfuse OpenAI drop-in replacement to trace all parts of your application.


> **What is Baseten?** [Baseten](https://docs.baseten.co/overview) is an inference platform that enables developers to deploy and scale machine learning models in production. It provides fast, reliable model inference with support for popular open-source models through an OpenAI-compatible API.


> **What is Langfuse?** [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is an open source LLM engineering platform that helps teams trace API calls, monitor performance, and debug issues in their AI applications.


<Steps>
## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Make sure you have installed the necessary Python packages:



```python
%pip install openai langfuse -q

```

## Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables



```python
import os

# Get keys for your project from the project settings page: https://cloud.langfuse.com
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_BASE_URL"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇪🇺 EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_BASE_URL"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇺🇸 US region

# Get your Baseten API key from https://app.baseten.co/settings/api_keys
os.environ["BASETEN_API_KEY"] = "..."

```

## Step 3: Langfuse OpenAI drop-in Replacement

In this step we use the native [OpenAI drop-in replacement](https://langfuse.com/docs/observability/sdk/instrumentation) by importing `from langfuse.openai import openai`.

To start using Baseten with OpenAI's client libraries, pass in your Baseten API key to the `api_key` option, and change the `base_url` to `https://inference.baseten.co/v1`:



```python
# instead of import openai:
from langfuse.openai import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
  api_key=os.environ.get("BASETEN_API_KEY"),
  base_url="https://inference.baseten.co/v1",
)
```

## Step 4: Run An Example

The following cell demonstrates how to call Baseten's chat model using the traced OpenAI client. All API calls will be automatically traced by Langfuse.


```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="zai-org/GLM-4.6",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a travel agent. Be descriptive and helpful."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me the top 3 things to do in San Francisco"},
  ],
  name="baseten-example-trace"
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Step 5: See Traces in Langfuse

After running the example model call, you can see the traces in Langfuse. You will see detailed information about your Baseten API calls, including:

- Request parameters (model, messages, temperature, etc.)
- Response content
- Token usage statistics
- Latency metrics

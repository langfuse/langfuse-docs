# Observability for Cerebras with Langfuse

This guide shows you how to integrate [Cerebras](https://cerebras.ai/) with Langfuse. Cerebras's API is fully compatible with OpenAI's client libraries, allowing us to use the Langfuse OpenAI drop-in replacement to trace all parts of your application.

> **What is Cerebras?** [Cerebras](https://inference-docs.cerebras.ai/) is a high-throughput, low-latency inference platform built on Cerebras’ wafer-scale processors (WSE) and CS systems, optimized specifically for token generation at scale.

> **What is Langfuse?** [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is an open source LLM engineering platform that helps teams trace API calls, monitor performance, and debug issues in their AI applications.

<Steps>
## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Make sure you have installed the necessary Python packages:


```python
%pip install openai langfuse -q
```

## Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables


```python
import os

# Get keys for your project from the project settings page: https://cloud.langfuse.com
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..." 
os.environ["LANGFUSE_BASE_URL"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇪🇺 EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_BASE_URL"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇺🇸 US region

# Get your Cerebras API key from https://cloud.cerebras.ai/
os.environ["CEREBRAS_API_KEY"] = "csk-..."
```

## Step 3: Langfuse OpenAI drop-in Replacement

In this step we use the native [OpenAI drop-in replacement](https://langfuse.com/docs/observability/sdk/instrumentation) by importing `from langfuse.openai import openai`.

To start using Cerebras with OpenAI's client libraries, pass in your Cerebras API key to the `api_key` option, and change the `base_url` to `https://api.cerebras.ai/v1`:



```python
# instead of import openai:
from langfuse.openai import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
  api_key=os.environ.get("CEREBRAS_API_KEY"),
  base_url="https://api.cerebras.ai/v1",
)
```

## Step 4: Run An Example

The following cell demonstrates how to call Cerebras's chat model using the traced OpenAI client. All API calls will be automatically traced by Langfuse.



```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="zai-glm-4.6",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a travel agent. Be descriptive and helpful."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me the top 3 things to do in San Francisco"},
  ],
  name="cerebras-travel-agent"
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Step 5: See Traces in Langfuse

After running the example model call, you can see the traces in Langfuse. You will see detailed information about your Cerebras API calls, including:

- Request parameters (model, messages, temperature, etc.)
- Response content
- Token usage statistics
- Latency metrics

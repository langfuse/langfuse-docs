# Cookbook: Monitor ü§ó Hugging Face Models with ü™¢ Langfuse

This cookbook shows you how to monitor Hugging Face models using the OpenAI SDK integration with [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com). This allows you to collaboratively debug, monitor and evaluate your LLM applications.

With this integration, you can test and evaluate different models, monitor your application's cost and assign scores such as user feedback or human annotations.

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
**Note**: *In this example, we use the OpenAI SDK to [access the Hugging Face inference APIs](https://huggingface.co/blog/tgi-messages-api). You can also use other frameworks, such as [Langchain](https://langfuse.com/integrations/frameworks/langchain), or ingest the data via our [API](https://api.reference.langfuse.com/).*

## Setup

### Install Required Packages


```python
%pip install langfuse openai --upgrade
```

### Set Environment Variables

Set up your environment variables with the necessary keys. Get keys for your Langfuse project from [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com). Also, obtain an access token from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).



```python
import os

# Get keys for your project from https://cloud.langfuse.com
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..." # Private Project
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..." # Private Project
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com"  # üá™üá∫ EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com"  # üá∫üá∏ US region

os.environ["HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN"] = "hf_..."
```

### Import Necessary Modules

Instead of importing `openai` directly, import it from `langfuse.openai`. Also, import any other necessary modules.


```python
# Instead of: import openai
from langfuse.openai import OpenAI
from langfuse import observe
```

### Initialize the OpenAI Client for Hugging Face Models

Initialize the OpenAI client but point it to the Hugging Face model endpoint. You can use any model hosted on Hugging Face that supports the OpenAI API format. Replace the model URL and access token with your own.

For this example, we use the `Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct` model.


```python
# Initialize the OpenAI client, pointing it to the Hugging Face Inference API
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct" + "/v1/",  # replace with your endpoint url
    api_key= os.getenv('HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN'),  # replace with your token
)
```

## Examples

### Chat Completion Request

Use the `client` to make a chat completion request to the Hugging Face model. The `model` parameter can be any identifier since the actual model is specified in the `base_url.` In this example, we set the model variable  `tgi`, short for [Text Generation Inference](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/en/index). 


```python
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="model-name",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Write a poem about language models"
        }
    ]
)
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Observe the Request with Langfuse

By using the `OpenAI` client from `langfuse.openai`, your requests are automatically traced in Langfuse. You can also use the `@observe()` decorator to group multiple generations into a single trace.


```python
@observe()  # Decorator to automatically create a trace and nest generations
def generate_rap():
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        name="rap-generator",
        model="tgi",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a poet."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "Compose a rap about the open source LLM engineering platform Langfuse."}
        ],
        metadata={"category": "rap"},
    )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content

rap = generate_rap()
print(rap)
```

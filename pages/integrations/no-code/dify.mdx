# Dify - Observability & Metrics for Your LLM Apps

**Dify** ([GitHub](https://github.com/langgenius/dify)) is an open-source LLM app development platform which is natively integrated with Langfuse. With the native integration, you can use Dify to quickly create complex LLM applications and then use Langfuse to monitor and improve them.

## Setup

1. Create project in Langfuse and get API credentials in project settings.
1. In Dify: Navigate to `Monitoring` settings of you Dify app.
1. Add Langfuse via `Third-party LLMOps provider` menu.
1. Invoke Dify application via UI or API to start capturing traces and metrics in Langfuse.

## Mapping of Dify to Langfuse

The integration automatically maps the following fields from Dify to Langfuse:

| Dify                               | Langfuse                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `user`                             | [`userId`](/docs/tracing/users)       |
| [`message_id`](https://docs.dify.ai/api-reference/completion/create-completion-message#response-message-id)                          | [`trace_id`](/docs/tracing-data-model)                            |
| `conversation_id`                  | [`sessionId`](/docs/tracing/sessions) |
|                                    | `trace.name`                          |
| type of application, type of model | [`tags`](/docs/tracing/tags)          |

## Langfuse Prompt Management

The [Langfuse Prompt Management Plugin](https://github.com/gao-ai-com/dify-plugin-langfuse) (community maintained) lets you use prompts that are managed and versioned in Langfuse in your Dify applications, enhancing your LLM application development workflow. Key features include:

- **Get Prompt:** Fetch specific prompts managed in Langfuse.
- **Search Prompts:** Search for prompts in Langfuse using various filters.
- **Update Prompt:** Create new versions of prompts in Langfuse and set tags/labels.

This integration streamlines the process of managing and versioning your prompts, contributing to more efficient development and iteration cycles. You can find the plugin and installation instructions [here](https://github.com/gao-ai-com/dify-plugin-langfuse).

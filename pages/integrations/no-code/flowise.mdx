# Flowise Observability & Tracing

## What is Flowise?

**Flowise** ([GitHub](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise)) is an open-source, no-code platform for building LLM applications using a visual drag-and-drop editor. It lets you create complex AI workflows — including chatbots, RAG pipelines, and multi-step agent chains — without writing code.

Key features of Flowise include:
- **Visual workflow builder** — Drag and drop components to build LLM chains, agents, and RAG pipelines
- **Pre-built integrations** — Connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, Pinecone, and dozens of other providers
- **API-first design** — Every flow can be exposed as an API endpoint for integration with your applications
- **Embeddable chat widget** — Embed your chatbots directly into web pages
- **Extensible** — Add custom nodes and components to extend functionality

## Langfuse Integration

With the native Langfuse integration, you can use Flowise to quickly create complex LLM applications in no-code and then use Langfuse to monitor, trace, and improve them.

The integration supports all use cases of Flowise, including: interactively in the UI, API, and embeds. Once connected, Langfuse automatically captures detailed traces for every request, including model parameters, token usage, costs, and latency.

## Integration

<Steps>

### Obtain Langfuse API keys

<Tabs items={["Langfuse cloud", "local or self-hosted"]}>
<Tab>

1. Create account and project on
   [cloud.langfuse.com](https://cloud.langfuse.com/auth/sign-up)
2. Copy API keys for your
   project

</Tab>
<Tab>

1. Follow [instructions](/docs/get-started/) on self-hosting or local setups
2. Copy API keys for your
   project

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Run Flowise

```sh
# install
npm install -g flowise

# start
npx flowise start
```

### Add Langfuse

You can optionally add `release` to tag the current version of the flow. You usually don't need to change the other options.

</Steps>

## Mapping of Flowise to Langfuse

The integration automatically maps the following fields from Flowise to Langfuse:

| Flowise                                                         | Langfuse                                     | Required version                                                                     |

## Override Config

The Flowise allows you to pass additional parameters as `overrideConfig` to the Langfuse API. This can be used to pass additional information to Langfuse, such as `userId` for user-level tracking.

Learn more about `overrideConfig` in the [Flowise Prediction API documentation](https://docs.flowiseai.com/api-reference/prediction).

```json
{
  "question": "hi there",
  "overrideConfig": {
    "analytics": {
      "langFuse": {
        "userId": "user1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

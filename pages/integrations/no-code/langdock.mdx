# Langdock Integration

**Langdock** is an all-in-one, enterprise-ready AI platform that lets teams roll out private, use-case-specific assistants in minutes—no code required and fully GDPR-compliant. From a single dashboard, you can spin up assistants by combining custom instructions and company knowledge, share them via a secure chat interface, Slack or API, and monitor usage across your organization.

When connected to Langfuse, every assistant execution is automatically traced, evaluated and visualized so you can iterate with data instead of guesswork.

## What is Langdock?

Langdock is a **no-code agent builder** that enables teams to create and deploy AI assistants without technical expertise. Key features include:

- **Private AI assistants** with custom instructions and company knowledge
- **Multiple deployment options** including secure chat, Slack, and API
- **Enterprise-grade security** with GDPR compliance
- **Centralized monitoring** across your organization
- **Seamless integrations** with existing tools and workflows

## Why integrate with Langfuse?

| Capability | What you gain with Langfuse |
|------------|---------------------------|
| **Tracing** | Drill into every prompt, model response, tool call and retrieval step |
| **Dashboards** | Track latency, token usage and error rates live |
| **A/B testing** | Compare prompt versions or agent configs side-by-side |
| **Custom metrics & alerts** | Define pass/fail rules and catch regressions before users notice |

## Setup

Get started in 3 quick steps (≈ 5 min):

### 1. Create a Langfuse project

- Sign up at [cloud.langfuse.com](https://cloud.langfuse.com) (or log in to your self-hosted instance)
- Go to **Project → Settings → API Keys** and copy your **Public Key**, **Secret Key**, and (if self-hosted) your **Base URL**

### 2. Create an assistant in Langdock

- Open the Langdock dashboard → **Assistants** → **New assistant**
- Name your assistant, add instructions and optionally upload documents or connect tools
- Click **Save**

### 3. Connect Langfuse inside Langdock

- Still in the assistant, open **Settings → Integrations → Langfuse**
- Toggle **Enable**, paste the **Public Key**, **Secret Key** and **Base URL**, then **Save**

That's it! The next conversation with your assistant will stream traces to Langfuse automatically.

## What's next?

- Head to **Langfuse → Traces** to see live data flowing in
- [Tag traces](/docs/tracing-features/tags) or create comparisons to evaluate prompt or retrieval changes
- Define [custom metrics](/docs/scores/custom) and set up alerts so you're notified if quality drops
- Use [Langfuse Prompt Management](/docs/prompts/get-started) to version and manage your assistant instructions
- Add [user feedback scoring](/docs/scores/user-feedback) to continuously improve your assistants

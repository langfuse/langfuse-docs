# Langdock Integration

**Langdock** is an enterprise-ready AI platform that lets teams create private, use-case-specific assistants in minutes—no code required and fully GDPR-compliant. Deploy assistants via secure chat, Slack, or API, and monitor usage across your organization.

When connected to Langfuse, every assistant execution is automatically traced, evaluated and visualized.

## Why integrate with Langfuse?

| Capability | What you gain with Langfuse |
|------------|---------------------------|
| **Tracing** | Drill into every prompt, model response, tool call and retrieval step |
| **Dashboards** | Track latency, token usage and error rates live |
| **A/B testing** | Compare prompt versions or agent configs side-by-side |
| **Custom metrics & alerts** | Define pass/fail rules and catch regressions before users notice |

## Setup

<Steps>

### Get Langfuse API keys

1. Sign up at [cloud.langfuse.com](https://cloud.langfuse.com) (or log in to your self-hosted instance)
2. Go to **Project → Settings → API Keys** and copy your **Public Key**, **Secret Key**, and (if self-hosted) your **Base URL**

### Create an assistant in Langdock

1. Open the Langdock dashboard → **Assistants** → **New assistant**
2. Name your assistant, add instructions and optionally upload documents or connect tools
3. Click **Save**

### Connect Langfuse integration

1. In the assistant, open **Settings → Integrations → Langfuse**
2. Toggle **Enable**, paste the **Public Key**, **Secret Key** and **Base URL**, then **Save**

That's it! The next conversation with your assistant will stream traces to Langfuse automatically.

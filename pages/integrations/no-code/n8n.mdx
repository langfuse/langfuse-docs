# Integration: n8n

> [n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) is a fair-code licensed workflow automation platform.

Langfuse Prompt Management is available via an n8n node. Learn more in the [n8n Node documentation](/docs/prompts/n8n-node).

## Tracing Integration

### Officially Supported

Currently, there is no native n8n tracing integration. Please upvote the related GitHub discussion [here](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/4397) if you are interested in this.

[@rorubyy](https://github.com/rorubyy) has created a n8n node for that wraps OpenAI models and sends tracing data to Langfuse. You can find it here: [rorubyy/n8n-nodes-openai-langfuse](https://github.com/rorubyy/n8n-nodes-openai-langfuse)

Alternatively, [@rwb-truelime](https://github.com/rwb-truelime) has developed [n8n-langfuse-shipper](https://github.com/rwb-truelime/n8n-langfuse-shipper), a Python project that ships n8n execution data to Langfuse using the OTEL (OpenTelemetry) API. This approach provides a broader integration by capturing workflow execution data from n8n and forwarding it to Langfuse for observability and tracing.

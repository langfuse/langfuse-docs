# Ragflow Observability & Tracing

**[Ragflow](https://ragflow.io/)** ([GitHub](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow)) is a no-code / low-code framework to design and run Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) pipelines.

With the native Langfuse integration you can build complex RAG pipelines in Ragflow and then use Langfuse to monitor, debug and improve them.

The integration works for all execution modes of Ragflow: interactive runs in the UI, scheduled jobs and API calls.

## Integration

<Steps>

### Get Langfuse API keys

<Tab>

1. Create an account and project on [cloud.langfuse.com](https://cloud.langfuse.com/auth/sign-up)
2. Copy the **public** and **secret** API keys for your project

</Tab>
<Tab>

1. Follow the [self-hosting guide](/docs/get-started/) to run Langfuse locally or on-prem
2. Copy the **public** and **secret** API keys for your project

</Tabs>

### Configure Ragflow

You can configure Langfuse in the Ragflow API settings (scroll to bottom). Please note that you first have to configure an LLM in the Ragflow settings.

### Run your pipeline and inspect traces

Execute a pipeline from the Ragflow UI or trigger it via the API. Ragflow will automatically send structured trace data to Langfuse.

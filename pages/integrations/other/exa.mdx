# Exa Integration

In this guide, we'll show you how to integrate [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) with [Exa](https://exa.ai/) to trace your AI search operations. By leveraging Langfuse's tracing capabilities, you can automatically capture details such as inputs, outputs, and execution times of your Exa search functions.

> **What is Exa?** [Exa](https://exa.ai/) is an AI-powered search API built for LLMs and AI applications. Unlike traditional search engines, Exa is designed to understand semantic meaning and retrieve high-quality, relevant results that are perfect for AI use cases like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), research, and content discovery.

> **What is Langfuse?** [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is an open source LLM engineering platform that helps teams trace API calls, monitor performance, and debug issues in their AI applications.

<Steps>
## Install Dependencies

First, install the necessary Python packages:

```python
%pip install langfuse exa-py
```

### Set Up Environment Variables

Get your Langfuse API keys by signing up for [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com) or [self-hosting Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting). You'll also need your Exa and OpenAI API key.

```python
import os

# Get keys for your project from the project settings page: https://cloud.langfuse.com
os.environ["LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "pk-lf-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY"] = "sk-lf-..."
os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇪🇺 EU region
# os.environ["LANGFUSE_HOST"] = "https://us.cloud.langfuse.com" # 🇺🇸 US region

# Your Exa API key
os.environ["EXA_API_KEY"] = "..."

# Your openai key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."
```

With the environment variables set, we can now initialize the Exa and the Langfuse client.

```python
from exa_py import Exa
from langfuse import get_client

exa = Exa(api_key= os.environ["EXA_API_KEY"])
langfuse = get_client()
```

## Example 1: Trace Exa `search_and_contents`

To monitor your Exa search operations, we use the [Langfuse `@observe()` decorator](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python/decorators). In this example, the `@observe()` decorator captures the inputs, outputs, and execution time of the `search_with_exa()` function. For more control over the data you are sending to Langfuse, you can use the [Context Manager or create manual observations](https://langfuse.com/docs/observability/sdk/python/instrumentation#custom-instrumentation) using the Python SDK.

```python
from langfuse import observe

@observe(as_type="retriever")
def search_with_exa(query: str, num_results: int = 5):
    """Search the web using Exa AI and return results."""
    results = exa.search_and_contents(
        query,
        num_results=num_results,
        text=True
    )
    return results

# Example: Search for information about Langfuse
search_results = search_with_exa("What is Langfuse and how does it help with LLM observability?")

# Display the results
for result in search_results.results:
    print(f"Title: {result.title}")
    print(f"URL: {result.url}")
    print(f"Text: {result.text[:200]}...\n")
```

## Example 2: Exa Search together with OpenAI

You can also trace more complex workflows that involve summarizing the search results with OpenAI. Here we use the [Langfuse `@observe()` decorator](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python/decorators) to group both the Exa search and the OpenAI generation into one trace.

```python
import os
from langfuse.openai import OpenAI

@observe()
def search_and_summarize(query: str):

    # 1. Exa search
    @observe(as_type="retriever")
    def search_with_exa(query: str, num_results: int = 5):
        """Search the web using Exa AI and return results."""
        results = exa.search_and_contents(
            query,
            num_results=num_results,
            text=True
        )
        return results

    results = search_with_exa(query)

    # 2. Build a short context
    context = "\n".join([f"{r.title} ({r.url}): {r.text}" for r in results.results])

    # 3. Summarize with OpenAI
    client = OpenAI()
    resp = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-5-mini",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "Summarize the following search results clearly and concisely."},
            {"role": "user", "content": context}
        ]
    )

    print("Summary:\n", resp.choices[0].message.content)

search_and_summarize("What is Langfuse and how does it help with LLM observability?")
```

## See Traces in Langfuse

After executing the traced functions, log in to your [Langfuse Dashboard](https://cloud.langfuse.com) to view detailed trace logs. You'll be able to see:

- Search queries and their parameters
- Response times for each API call
- Nested traces showing the relationship between search and similarity operations
- Full input and output data for debugging

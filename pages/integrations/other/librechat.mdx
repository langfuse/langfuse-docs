# Trace LibreChat with Langfuse

This guide shows you how to integrate [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) tracing with [LibreChat](https://www.librechat.ai/) to get full observability into your AI conversations.

> **What is LibreChat?** [LibreChat](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat) is an open-source AI chat platform that brings together multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure, and more) into a unified interface. 

> **What is Langfuse?** [Langfuse](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse) is an open-source LLM observability platform that helps you trace, monitor, and debug your LLM applications.


<Steps>
## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. A running LibreChat instance (see [LibreChat Installation Guide](https://www.librechat.ai/docs/quick_start/local_setup))
2. A Langfuse account ([sign up for free](https://cloud.langfuse.com))
3. Langfuse API keys from your project settings

## Configure LibreChat Environment Variables

LibreChat uses environment variables for configuration. Add the following Langfuse-related variables to your `.env` file in your LibreChat installation directory:

```bash
# Langfuse Configuration
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-***
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-***

# 🇪🇺 EU Data Region
LANGFUSE_BASE_URL=https://cloud.langfuse.com

# 🇺🇸 US Data Region
# LANGFUSE_BASE_URL=https://us.cloud.langfuse.com
```

> **Note**: For self-hosted Langfuse instances, set `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` to your custom URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for local development).

## Restart LibreChat

After adding the environment variables, restart your LibreChat instance to apply the changes.

## See traces in Langfuse

Once LibreChat is restarted with Langfuse configured, you can see a new trace for every chat message response in the Langfuse UI:

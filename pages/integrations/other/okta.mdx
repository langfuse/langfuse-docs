# Okta

This guide will cover how to setup Okta authentication and user provisioning for Langfuse.
Authentication and provisioning are two separate steps in Okta.
Follow the one that is applicable to your use case.

## Authentication

For authentication, Langfuse supports the [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/connect/) protocol.
This allows you to use Okta as an identity provider for Langfuse.
To set up Okta authentication, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Okta Application**:
   - Log in to your Okta admin console.
   - Navigate to **Applications** > **Create App Integration**.
   - Choose **OIDC - OpenID Connect** as the sign-in method and click **Next**.
   - Choose **Web Application** as the application type and click **Next**.
   - Fill in the application settings. Use your self-hosted domain or one of the Langfuse Cloud domains.
     - **App name**: `Langfuse`
     - **Login redirect URIs**: `https://your-langfuse-domain.com/api/auth/callback/okta`
     - **Logout redirect URIs**: `https://your-langfuse-domain.com/`
   - Click **Save**.
2. **Setup Langfuse (Cloud)**:
   - Please reach out to the Langfuse support team at support@langfuse.com to configure Okta SSO.
   - Once the SSO is configured, you can type in your email on the sign-in page and are automatically redirected to Okta.
3. **Setup Langfuse (Self-Hosted)**:
   - Follow the Langfuse [SSO guide](/self-hosting/authentication-and-sso#okta) to configure Okta as an identity provider.
   - Once the environment variables are set, you will see an "Okta" button on your sign-in page.
4. **Test the Integration**:
   - Assign users to your Okta application and test the login flow.
   - For any issues, please create an issue on [GitHub](/issues) or contact support.

## User Provisioning

For user provisioning, Langfuse supports the SCIM 2.0 protocol.
To setup user provisioning in Okta, follow these steps:

1. **Create a SAML/SCIM Application**:
   - Log in to your Okta admin console.
   - Navigate to **Applications** > **Browser App Catalog**.
   - Search for **SCIM** and select **SCIM 2.0 Test App (Basic Auth)**.
   - Click **Add integration**.
   - Fill in the application settings:
     - **Application label**: `Langfuse SCIM`
   - Click **Next** and then **Done**. There is no need to configure the Sign-On Options.
2. **Configure SCIM Settings**:
   - In the **Provisioning** tab, click **Configure API Integration**.
   - Enable the **Enable API Integration** checkbox.
   - Fill in the SCIM endpoint and token:
     - **SCIM Base URL**: `https://your-langfuse-domain.com/api/scim/v2`
     - **Authorization Method**: `HTTP Header`
     - **Authorization Header**: `Bearer YOUR_SCIM_API_TOKEN`
   - Click **Test API Credentials** to verify the connection.
   - Enter your credentials:
     - **SCIM 2.0 Base Url**: `https://your-langfuse-domain.com/api/public/scim`
     - **Username**: Use a public key from your Organization settings.
     - **Password**: Use a private key from your Organization settings.
     - Turn off **Import Groups**.
     - Test the API credentials and press **Save**.
3. **Configure Provisioning**:
   - In the **Provisioning** tab, enable the following options:
     - **Create Users**
     - **Update User Attributes**
     - **Deactivate Users**
   - Click **Save**.
4. **Add Default User Permissions** (Optional):
   - In the **Provisioning** tab, modify the `roles` attribute to set default permissions for new users.
   - You can set it for all users of the application to provide a default. Set it to "NONE", "VIEWER", "MEMBER", or "ADMIN".
5. **Assign Users**:
   - Navigate to the **Assignments** tab.
   - Click **Assign** > **Assign to People**.
   - Select the users you want to assign to the Langfuse SCIM application. You can overwrite the role here.
   - Click **Done** and then **Save**.
   - Users should appear as Member within your Langfuse Organization.

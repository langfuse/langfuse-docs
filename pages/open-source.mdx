# Langfuse's Open-Source Strategy

> Langfuse is built in the open. We believe open source and sustainable commercialization can coexist—and this strategy is how we fund continuous, community-driven innovation that's adopted across startups and enterprises.
>
> Do you have any questions? Please reach out to the maintainers via [GitHub Discussions](/gh-support).

<Callout type="info">

All product capabilities—tracing, evaluations, prompt management, experiments, annotation, the playground, and more—are MIT licensed without any usage limits. Enterprise modules such as SCIM, audit logging, and data retention policies require a commercial license when you self-host Langfuse.

## Why is Langfuse open source?

1. **Transparency & Trust**: Developers can inspect every line that handles their data, audit security practices, and avoid vendor lock-in.
2. **Community Collaboration**: The open source community moves quickly and accelerates [integrations](/docs/integrations/overview) with LangChain, LiteLLM, OpenTelemetry, and the next library you'll build tomorrow. Join our community on [GitHub Discussions](/ideas) to shape the [roadmap](/docs/roadmap).
3. **Faster Innovation**: Shared ownership means bugs are squashed and features land sooner.
4. **Sovereignty**: You can run Langfuse anywhere — from your laptop to an air-gapped cluster — without hitting artificial usage caps. [Self-host](/self-hosting) it on your own infrastructure.
5. **Extensible**: All data is accessible via the public [API](/docs/api) which is fully tested. You can wrap/extend Langfuse or build your own workflows and AI platform around it.

## Licensing Overview

Self-hosting keeps data within your infrastructure; Cloud offloads operational overhead. Because every deployment runs the same codebase and schema, **you can switch between OSS, Enterprise self-host, and Langfuse Cloud at any time**. Add or remove a license key or switch to the Langfuse Cloud endpoints. No feature flags to untangle, no vendor lock-in, and no downtime.

### Langfuse OSS

Langfuse's OSS includes all product features and has no usage limits. Fork it, extend it, ship it—even in commercial products. All core APIs and backend logic scale horizontally out-of-the-box, so the same deployment can grow from a single-node Docker Compose to a multi-node Kubernetes cluster—without code changes or feature gates. It's the same architecture that powers Langfuse Cloud.

### Commercial Extensions

Enterprise Edition (EE) modules live in clearly marked `/ee` directories. These are shipped as source code, but require a [license key](/self-hosting/license-key) to run. They are optional; the core works 100% without them.

## Architecture Consistency & Scale

The Langfuse deployment stack is exactly the same for OSS, Enterprise self-host, and Langfuse Cloud. See our [Self-Hosting Guide](/self-hosting) for instructions on running Langfuse locally and deployments at production scale.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Langfuse really open source?

Yes. Everything outside the `/ee` folders is MIT-licensed — an OSI-approved license. You get the four freedoms: use, study, modify, distribute.

### Will I accidentally use EE features?

No. EE packages are isolated and gated by the license key check. You can run the core image without a key without running EE code.

### Which self-host licensing options exist?

All product features are freely available under the MIT license. A commercial **Enterprise** license is only required for advanced security capabilities such as SCIM, extended audit logging, and data retention policies (see [pricing page](/pricing)).

Upgrading is as simple as setting `LANGFUSE_EE_LICENSE_KEY` ([docs](/self-hosting/license-key)) in your deployment; containers pick up the change at runtime.

### Does Langfuse rely only on open-source components?

Yes. The entire stack is open source and can be self-hosted. Find a complete list in the configuration files across our repositories:

- Langfuse server: monorepo with [multiple `package.json` files](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Alangfuse%2Flangfuse%20package.json&type=code)
- Langfuse Python SDK: main [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-python/blob/main/pyproject.toml)
- Langfuse JS SDK: monorepo with [multiple `package.json` files](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Alangfuse%2Flangfuse-js%20package.json&type=code)

As the core Langfuse server is most actively developed, we run an [automated license check](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/actions/workflows/licensecheck.yml) on every change to avoid adding dependencies with non-permissive licenses. If you find any issues, please let us know.

### What's the release cadence and how do I stay up to date?

We cut a **GitHub Release multiple times a week** (tagged `vX.Y.Z`) and publish detailed notes in the [changelog](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/releases). Langfuse Cloud is always running the latest version; self-host users can pull the identical Docker image tag to stay up to date or upgrade on their own schedule ([docs](/self-hosting/upgrade)).

### Does the OSS build phone home? Can I disable telemetry?

By default, Langfuse reports **aggregated usage analytics** (no personal data) so we know which features matter. **No traces, prompts, or customer data leave your cluster.** You can opt out of this.

### Can I run Langfuse completely offline / air-gapped?

Yes. After the initial image pull, Langfuse **does not require any outbound network calls** to work. Teams in regulated environments run it inside air-gapped Kubernetes clusters; just disable telemetry as above and mirror the Docker registry locally.

### How do I contribute?

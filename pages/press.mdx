## Why does Langfuse exist?

Langfuse exists to accelerate the deployment of reliable, safe, explainable and cost-effective AI applications and agents.

AI will create meaningful value for society and drive economic growth and we are still in the early days of seeing this impact. Over time, every successful company will be an AI company, with AI at the core of its strategy, value creation, and business processes. Most value creation will happen at the application-layer, split between incumbents and AI-native startups.

We’re building an [integrated](/integrations) and [open](/handbook/chapters/open-source) tooling layer to help teams with:

- **Visibility & explainability** → _Langfuse Observability_ (production tracing, metrics, and analytics)
- **Collaboration across disciplines** → _Prompt management, shareable views & dashboards_
- **Evaluation & data operations** → _Langfuse Evaluations (evals, datasets, labeling)_

We are independent, vendor-neutral, and available as cloud or self-hosted at production scale.

# AI Powered Features Within Langfuse (Beta)

Langfuse offers AI-powered features within the product to simplify and speed up your workflows. These features are currently in beta and are only available on Langfuse Cloud.

## Opt-in

All AI-powered features require an opt-in; they are not enabled by default. The opt-in is managed at the organization level and can be changed by an [admin or owner](/docs/administration/rbac).

The setting applies to all users and projects within the organization.

## Available AI Features

Non-exhaustive list of available AI features in Langfuse:

- Natural language-based filter builder for tables

## Data Privacy

Langfuse's AI features are powered by models hosted on AWS Bedrock:

- We use models in the same AWS region as your [Langfuse data region](/security/data-regions).
- Amazon Bedrock has a zero data retention policy, no logging, provider isolation, and does not train on your data. See [Bedrock data protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/data-protection.html) for more details.
- Data is never shared with third parties, such as the model developer.
- AWS Bedrock is fully HIPAA, SOC2 and ISO 27001 compliant. See [Bedrock security and compliance](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/security-compliance/) and our [compliance overview](/security) for more details.

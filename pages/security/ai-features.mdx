# AI Powered Features Within Langfuse

Langfuse offers AI-powered features within the product to the benefit of the users.

All AI powered features are opt-in by default.
The opt-in is managed at the organization level by an admin or owner and the setting thus applies to all users and projects within the organization.

## Data Privacy

Langfuse's AI features are powered by models hosted on AWS Bedrock.

We use models in the same AWS region as the respective Langfuse instance is hosted in.
The model provider has a zero data retention policy, no logging, provider isolation and does not train on your data, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/data-protection.html).
Data is never shared with third parties, such as the model developer.

AWS Bedrock is fully HIPAA, SOC2 and ISO 27001 compliant, see [here](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/security-compliance/) for more details.

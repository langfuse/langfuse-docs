# Authentication & Authorization

Langfuse provides robust mechanisms for both authenticating users and authorizing their access to specific resources within the platform.

## Authentication

Authentication verifies the identity of a user attempting to access Langfuse.

Please refer to the following documentation pages for more details:

- [Authentication & SSO on Langfuse Cloud](/docs/administration/authentication-and-sso)
- [Authentication & SSO (self-hosted)](/self-hosting/security/authentication-and-sso)

## Authorization (RBAC)

Langfuse supports Role-based Access Control (RBAC). Please refer to the dedicated [RBAC documentation](/docs/rbac) for a detailed explanation of roles, permissions, and how to manage user access within organizations and projects.

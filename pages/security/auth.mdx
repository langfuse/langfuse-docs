# Authentication & Authorization

Langfuse provides robust mechanisms for both authenticating users and authorizing their access to specific resources within the platform.

## Authentication

Authentication verifies the identity of a user attempting to access Langfuse.

This document covers Langfuse Cloud. For self-hosted instances, please refer to the [Self-hosted Authentication and SSO guide](/self-hosting/security/authentication-and-sso).

### Email/Password authentication

By default, Langfuse uses email and password authentication. Langfuse enforces standard password complexity requirements.

If you signed up with a social login, you can add a password via the "reset password" link in the login page.

### Social Logins

For simplified access, users can sign in using their existing social accounts:

- Google
- GitHub
- Azure AD (Entra ID)

By default, Langfuse does not support switching between social logins or signing up with a social login after signing up with email/password. Please reach out to [support](/support) if you need help.

### Enterprise SSO & SSO Enforcement [#sso]

Langfuse supports **Enterprise SSO** (e.g. Okta, Azure AD, Keycloak etc.) via OIDC. Please reach out to [support](/support) to enable this feature.

To sign in with an Enterprise SSO provider, please (1) enter your email address, and (2) press "Continue". You will be redirected to the Enterprise SSO provider to authenticate.

Optionally, you can **enforce the use of SSO / social logins for your domain**. Please reach out to [support](/support) to enable this feature.

## Authorization (RBAC)

Langfuse supports Role-based Access Control (RBAC). Please refer to the dedicated [RBAC documentation](/docs/rbac) for a detailed explanation of roles, permissions, and how to manage user access within organizations and projects.

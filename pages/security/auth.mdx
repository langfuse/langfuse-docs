# Authentication & Authorization

Langfuse provides robust mechanisms for both authenticating users and authorizing their access to specific resources within the platform.

## Authentication

Authentication verifies the identity of a user attempting to access Langfuse.

This document covers Langfuse Cloud. For self-hosted instances, please refer to the [Self-hosted Authentication and SSO guide](/self-hosting/authentication-and-sso).

### Email/Password authentication

By default, Langfuse uses email and password authentication. Langfuse enforces standard password complexity requirements.

If you signed up with a social login, you can add a password via the "reset password" link in the login page.

### Social Logins

For simplified access, users can sign in using their existing social accounts:

- Google
- GitHub
- Azure AD (Entra ID)

By default, Langfuse does not support switching between social logins or signing up with a social login after signing up with email/password. Please reach out to [support](/support) if you need help.

### Enterprise SSO & SSO Enforcement [#sso]

Langfuse supports **Enterprise SSO** (e.g. Okta, Azure AD, Keycloak etc.). Please reach out to [support](/support) to enable this feature.

To sign in with an Enterprise SSO provider, please (1) enter your email address, and (2) start the "SSO" login flow.

Optionally, you can **enforce the use of SSO / social logins for your domain**. Please reach out to [support](/support) to enable this feature.

## Authorization (RBAC)

Langfuse supports Role-based Access Control (RBAC). Please refer to the dedicated [RBAC documentation](/docs/rbac) for a detailed explanation of roles, permissions, and how to manage user access within organizations and projects.

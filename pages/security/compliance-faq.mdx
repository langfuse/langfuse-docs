## Governance, People & Culture

> **How does the Acceptable Use Policy look like?**

Our policy ensures that all personnel undergo background checks (ID and reference calls), agree to our terms, and receive security awareness training to handle data responsibly. It mandates strict security measures such as whole-disk encryption on laptops, protection against malware, and rules for the proper handling of sensitive information. The policy governs the entire employee lifecycle, from secure onboarding to offboarding, to protect company and customer data.

> **How does the code of conduct look like?**

Our Code of Conduct establishes the highest standards of ethical business conduct, requiring all employees and contractors to act with integrity and comply with the law. It outlines our commitment to a safe, supportive, and inclusive work environment, with strict prohibitions against harassment, discrimination, and conflicts of interest. The policy provides clear channels for reporting concerns without fear of retaliation and details our procedures for protecting confidential information and company assets.

> **How does Langfuse manage physical security?**

Our Berlin and San Francisco office are to be treated as a shared space with controlled after-hours access, treated similarly to a co-working environment. Consequently, all personnel are required to follow a strict clean desk policy, utilizing lockable storage and shredders to ensure no sensitive information is left unattended. As we do not operate our own data center, all physical security for our data centers is managed by our third-party cloud providers.

> **Who owns security inside Langfuse?**

Langfuse CTO leads security efforts at Langfuse and reviews risk quarterly and drives continuous improvement. See [SOC 2 compliance](/security/soc2) for more details.

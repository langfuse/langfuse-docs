# Data Regions & Availability

Langfuse Cloud is designed for high availability and offers multiple data regions to meet your needs.

Our database and application run on AWS infrastructure, partly managed by Clickhouse.

## Langfuse Cloud Regions

All data, user accounts, and infrastructure are completely separated between the regions. You can have accounts in each regions.

| Region                                    | URL                                                                    | Location                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **US**                                    | [`https://us.cloud.langfuse.com`](https://us.cloud.langfuse.com)       | Oregon (AWS `us-west-2`)  |
| **EU**                                    | [`https://cloud.langfuse.com`](https://cloud.langfuse.com)             | Ireland (AWS `eu-west-1`) |
| **HIPAA** ([learn more](/security/hipaa)) | [`https://hipaa.cloud.langfuse.com`](https://hipaa.cloud.langfuse.com) | Oregon (AWS `us-west-2`)  |

## Connecting to a Region

To connect to a specific data region using the Langfuse SDKs, you need to set the base URL environment variable or pass it during initialization:

- **Python:** Set `LANGFUSE_HOST` environment variable or use the `host` parameter.
- **JS/TS:** Set `LANGFUSE_BASEURL` environment variable or use the `baseUrl` parameter.

Example base URLs:

- US: `https://us.cloud.langfuse.com`
- EU: `https://cloud.langfuse.com`
- HIPAA: `https://hipaa.cloud.langfuse.com`

Refer to the [SDK documentation](/docs/sdk) for detailed configuration instructions.

## Choosing a Region

When selecting a data region, consider the following factors:

- **Compliance and data privacy requirements:** Choose the region that aligns with your organization's data residency needs (e.g., GDPR often favors the EU region).
- **Latency for Prompt Management:** If using Langfuse [Prompt Management](/docs/prompt-management/overview), select the region closer to your application servers for lower latency when fetching prompts. This is hardly noticeable as the prompts are cached by the Langfuse SDK.
- **Latency for UI access:** Choose the region closer to your team's location for a faster experience when using the Langfuse web interface.

Less critical factor:

- **Tracing ingestion latency:** Trace data is sent asynchronously in batches, making ingestion latency less of a direct concern for application performance.

## Business Continuity & Availability

| Control               | Details                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **High availability** | Multi‑AZ databases & load‑balanced stateless application layer on AWS.                           |
| **Disaster recovery** | Encrypted backups stored cross‑region; tested at least annually                                  |
| **Status page**       | [https://status.langfuse.com](https://status.langfuse.com) with historical uptime and incidents. |

## Self-hosted Instances

Alternatively, you can self-host Langfuse for full control over your data and infrastructure. For installation and configuration, see: [Self-hosting guide](/self-hosting)

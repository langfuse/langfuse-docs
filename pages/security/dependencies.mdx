# Software Dependencies & Licensing

Langfuse is built using open-source components and maintains transparency about its dependencies and licensing.

Learn more about our open-source strategy [here](/docs/open-source).

## Open Source Components

Langfuse relies on open-source components for its core functionality. This commitment ensures transparency, allows community contributions, and enables users to self-host the entire stack.

You can inspect the source code for all core components on [GitHub](https://github.com/langfuse).

### Dependencies

**License Policy:** We run automated license checks on every code change to ensure all application-level dependencies (npm packages, Python packages) use permissive open-source licenses.
**Docker Images:** The Langfuse Docker images are based on standard Linux distributions and include OS-level packages (system utilities, libraries) that may be licensed under GPL 2.0 or similar copyleft licenses. These are standard components of Linux distributions and used commonly in the software industry.

For a detailed list of application dependencies, you can explore the following files in our repositories:

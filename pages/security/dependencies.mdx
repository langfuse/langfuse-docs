# Software Dependencies & Licensing

Langfuse is built using open source components and maintains transparency about its dependencies and licensing.

Learn more about our open source strategy [here](/docs/open-source).

## Open Source Components

Langfuse relies exclusively on open source components for its core functionality. This commitment ensures transparency, allows community contributions, and enables users to self-host the entire stack.

- **Transparency:** You can inspect the source code for all core components on [GitHub](https://github.com/langfuse).
- **License Checks:** We run automated checks on every code change to prevent the inclusion of dependencies with non-permissive licenses.

For a detailed list of dependencies, you can explore the `package.json` (for Node.js components) and `pyproject.toml` (for Python components) files within our repositories:

- Langfuse Server: [Multiple `package.json` files](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Alangfuse%2Flangfuse%20package.json&type=code)
- Langfuse Python SDK: [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-python/blob/main/pyproject.toml)
- Langfuse JS/TS SDK: [Multiple `package.json` files](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Alangfuse%2Flangfuse-js%20package.json&type=code)

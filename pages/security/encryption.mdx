# Encryption

Langfuse employs robust encryption methods to protect your data both while it's being transferred and while it's stored.

This page describes the encryption practices for Langfuse Cloud. For self-hosted deployments, please refer to the [Self-hosting Guide](/self-hosting/encryption).

## Encryption in Transit

All data transferred between your applications, the Langfuse SDKs, and the Langfuse server is encrypted using **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**. This ensures that data is protected from eavesdropping or tampering during transmission.

## Encryption at Rest

Data stored within the Langfuse infrastructure is encrypted at rest using **AES-256**, a strong industry-standard encryption algorithm.

This applies to data stored in:

| Service             | Encryption Standard |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Elasticache (Redis) | AES-256             |
| Aurora (Postgres)   | AES-256             |
| Clickhouse          | AES-256             |
| S3 / Blob Storage   | AES-256             |

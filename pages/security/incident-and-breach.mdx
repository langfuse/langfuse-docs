# Incident & Breach

## Incident Response

We follow a standard incident identification and response process. We post status updates on our [status page](https://status.langfuse.com).

## Notification

We will notify customers of any breach without delay. At most within 72 hours.

## Incident Response Plan 

Our Incident Response Plan provides a structured framework to ensure we detect and react to security incidents swiftly, requiring all personnel to report any suspected event within 24 hours. Once an incident is reported, it is investigated and assigned a severity level within 48 hours, which dictates the priority and timeline for the response. A dedicated team then works to contain, resolve, and recover from the incident, preserving forensic evidence and meticulously documenting all actions taken. Following resolution, we conduct a post-mortem analysis to identify the root cause, and in the event of a data breach involving sensitive information, we are committed to notifying all affected parties and relevant authorities.

# Security & Compliance Overview

**At Langfuse, we prioritize data privacy and security.** We understand that the data you entrust to us is a vital asset to your business, and we treat it with the utmost care.

We take active steps to demonstrate our commitment to data security and privacy such as annual SOC2 Type 2 and ISO27001 audits as well as External Penetration Tests. You can request access to the reports [here](/request-security-docs).

Langfuse is built with enterprise needs in mind, focusing on:

- **Security Measures:** Robust [Encryption](/security/encryption), access controls, and regular [Penetration Testing](/security/penetration-testing).
- **Privacy Measures:** Protecting user data according to regulations like [GDPR](/security/gdpr). We offer a [DPA](https://static.langfuse.com/legal/2025-02-17-Public-Langfuse%20DPA.docx.pdf) and adhere to our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

# Managing Personal Data

It is up to you to decide which kind of personal data you want to process with Langfuse.
You can manage how personal data is processed and retained via:

- [Data masking](/docs/tracing-features/masking): Mask PII data in traces, observations, and scores.
- [Data deletion](/docs/data-deletion): Delete personal data upon request; add [userIds](/docs/tracing-features/users) to tracing data to facilitate efficient deletion.
- [Data retention](/docs/data-retention): Control how long data is stored in Langfuse.

# Penetration Testing

Langfuse is committed to maintaining a high level of security. As part of this commitment, we undergo **annual external penetration tests**.

## Purpose

These tests are conducted by independent, third-party security experts to:

- Proactively identify potential security vulnerabilities in our infrastructure and application.
- Simulate real-world attack scenarios.
- Validate the effectiveness of our existing security controls.
- Ensure ongoing resilience against emerging threats.

## Reporting

The findings from these penetration tests help us continuously improve our security posture. Summaries of the results and remediation actions taken are documented.

- **Report Availability:** A summary of the latest penetration test report is available upon request for customers on the Pro, Team, or Enterprise plans.
- **Request Access:** You can request access to the report summary [here](/request-security-docs).

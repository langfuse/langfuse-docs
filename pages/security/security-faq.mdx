# Security FAQ

This page addresses frequently asked questions and common security topics for Langfuse.

If you don't find a solution to your issue here, try using [Ask AI](/docs/ask-ai) for instant answers or reach out to security@langfuse.com

> **How is data encrypted in transit and at rest?**

TLS 1.2+ protects traffic; all stored data uses AES‑256 encryption. See [encryption documentation](/security/encryption) and [self-hosted encryption](/self-hosting/configuration/encryption) for more details.

> **Do you ever use customer data to train models or analytics?**

No—customer traces and prompts are processed only to provide the Langfuse service and are never used to train internal or third‑party ML models. See [security overview](/docs/security/overview) for more details.

> **What retention, deletion and export controls exist?**

Each project can set its own retention window; data older than that is purged nightly, and users/API can trigger immediate deletion or export. See [data retention](/docs/data-retention) and [data deletion](/docs/data-deletion) documentation.

> **Can I deploy Langfuse in a single-tenant environment?**

Langfuse Cloud is multi-tenant only. For strict infrastructure-level isolation, we recommend Self-hosting Langfuse.

> **How is tenant isolation enforced?**

Cloud tenants are logically isolated by project‑level RBAC; on-premise deployments can use a dedicated database. See [RBAC documentation](/docs/rbac) for more details.

> **Can customers pin data to specific regions?**

Yes—EU, US and HIPAA‑ready US zones are available, and self‑hosted deployments let you choose any region.

## Compliance & Certifications

> **Which audits and attestations are in place?**

Langfuse Cloud is SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 compliant; GDPR & HIPAA controls are implemented. See [compliance overview](/security/soc2) for more details.

> **How often are third‑party pen tests performed, and are results shareable?**

Independent penetration tests occur annually, plus continuous vulnerability scans. See [penetration testing](/security/penetration-testing) for more details and past results.

## Identity & Access Management

> **Which authentication options are supported?**

OIDC SSO, email/password, and SCIM provisioning; MFA or passkeys can be enforced via your IdP. See auth documentation for more details.

> **How is least‑privilege enforced?**

RBAC lets you scope roles to organisation or project. See [RBAC documentation](/docs/rbac) for more details.

## Infrastructure & Network Security

> **Where is Langfuse Cloud hosted and how is the perimeter protected?**

Langfuse runs on AWS in isolated VPCs with WAF and AWS Shield for DDoS mitigation.

## Application Security & SDLC

> **What secure‑coding and testing practices are in place?**

Every commit passes our CI pipeline of end-to-end, unit, and security tests.

## Incident Response & Business Continuity

> **What is the incident‑response process?**

24 × 7 monitoring triggers an on‑call engineer; affected customers are notified and post‑mortems are published for larger incidents. See [incident and breach](/security/incident-and-breach) documentation for more details.

## Vulnerability & Pen‑Testing

> **How is the disclosure program run?**

Langfuse maintains a public responsible‑disclosure policy; CVSS drives remediation SLAs. See [penetration testing](/security/penetration-testing) for more details.

> **Can customers run their own pen‑tests?**

Yes—please run penetration tests in self-hosted deployments.

## Sub‑processors & Third‑Party Risk

> **Which sub‑processors have access to customer data?**

The live list is published [here](/security/subprocessors).

## Customer Controls & Shared Responsibility for Self-hosted Langfuse

> **Which obligations stay with the customer when I am self-hosting?**

Endpoint security, webhook endpoint hardening, backups, monitoring, and IAM hygiene on your side remain your responsibility. See [security overview](/docs/security/overview) for more details.

> **How should my backup strategy look like when I am self-hosting?**

We have a full guide around backups available to enable zero dataloss backups. See [the backup guide here](/self-hosting/configuration/backups).

> **Does Langfuse offer a managed Langfuse instance in my VPC?**

While we can offer support in the Enterprise tier, we do not operate installations on customer infrastructure. If self-hosting is not possible, we recommend using Langfuse Cloud.

## AI / LLM‑Specific Concerns

> **Does Langfuse store PII or trade secrets from prompts?**

Langfuse stores the data as-is. You can redact sensitive data via [data masking](/docs/observability/features/masking).

> **Can long‑term retention be disabled?**

Yes—you can configure custom [data retention](/docs/data-retention) policies.

> **Is prompt/trace data ever used for benchmarking or training?**

No. Langfuse does not repurpose customer data for external benchmarks or model training. See [security overview](/docs/security/overview) for more details.

## Governance, People & Culture

> **How are employees vetted and trained?**

All staff pass background checks, sign NDAs and complete security training. See [SOC 2 compliance](/security/soc2) for more details.

> **Who owns security inside Langfuse?**

Langfuse CTO leads security efforts at Langfuse and reviews risk quarterly and drives continuous improvement. See [SOC 2 compliance](/security/soc2) for more details.

# Vulnerability Management

Langfuse is committed to maintaining the security of its systems and protecting customer data. Our vulnerability management program is a key component of this commitment, designed to identify, assess, prioritize, and remediate security vulnerabilities in a timely manner.

## Identification

We employ a multi-layered approach to identify potential vulnerabilities:

- **Automated Scanning:** We utilize industry-standard tools, including **GitHub code scanning** and **Snyk**, to continuously scan our codebase, dependencies, and infrastructure for known vulnerabilities.
- **External Penetration Testing:** Langfuse undergoes regular [penetration tests](/security/penetration-testing) conducted by independent third-party security experts. Findings from these tests are integrated into our remediation process.
- **Responsible Disclosure Program:** We encourage security researchers to report potential vulnerabilities through our [responsible disclosure program](/security/responsible-disclosure).
- **Internal Reviews:** Our engineering teams conduct regular security reviews of code and infrastructure configurations.

## Triage and Remediation

Identified vulnerabilities are triaged based on severity and potential impact. High-priority vulnerabilities are addressed promptly according to predefined Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Our remediation process involves:

1.  **Assessment:** Understanding the vulnerability's impact and exploitability.
2.  **Prioritization:** Ranking vulnerabilities based on risk.
3.  **Remediation:** Applying patches, configuration changes, or code fixes.
4.  **Verification:** Confirming the vulnerability has been successfully addressed.

## Compliance

Our vulnerability management processes are designed to meet the requirements of our [**SOC 2 Type II**](/security/soc2) and [**ISO 27001**](/security/iso27001) certifications. This includes maintaining a formal Vulnerability Management Policy, regular scanning, timely remediation, and detailed record-keeping.

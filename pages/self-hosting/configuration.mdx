# Configuration

Langfuse has extensive configuration options via environment variables. These need to be passed to all application containers.

## Environment Variables

Langfuse accepts additional environment variables to fine-tune your deployment.
You can use the same environment variables for the Langfuse Web and Langfuse Worker containers.

### Core Infrastructure Settings

| Variable                                        | Required / Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`                                  | Required           | Connection string of your Postgres database. Instead of `DATABASE_URL`, you can also use `DATABASE_HOST`, `DATABASE_USERNAME`, `DATABASE_PASSWORD`, `DATABASE_NAME`, and `DATABASE_ARGS`.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `DIRECT_URL`                                    | `DATABASE_URL`     | Connection string of your Postgres database used for database migrations. Use this if you want to use a different user for migrations or use connection pooling on `DATABASE_URL`. **For large deployments**, configure the database user with long timeouts as migrations might need a while to complete.                                                                                            |
| `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL`                           |                    | If your database user lacks the `CREATE DATABASE` permission, you must create a shadow database and configure the "SHADOW_DATABASE_URL". This is often the case if you use a Cloud database. Refer to the [Prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/understanding-prisma-migrate/shadow-database#cloud-hosted-shadow-databases-must-be-created-manually) for detailed instructions. |

### Additional Features

There are additional features that can be enabled and configured via environment variables.

import SelfHostFeatures from "@/components-mdx/self-host-features.mdx";

## Timezones

Langfuse expects that its infrastructure components default to UTC.
Especially Postgres and ClickHouse settings that overwrite the UTC default are not supported and may lead to unexpected behavior.
Please vote on this [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/5046) if you would like us to consider supporting other timezones.

## Health and Readiness Check Endpoint

Langfuse web includes a health check endpoint at `/api/public/health` and a readiness check endpoint at `/api/public/ready` and the
Langfuse worker a health check endpoint at `/api/health`.
The health check endpoint indicates if the application is alive and the readiness check endpoint indicates if the application is ready to serve traffic.

Access the health and readiness check endpoints:

```bash
# langfuse-web
curl http://localhost:3000/api/public/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/public/ready

# langfuse-worker
curl http://localhost:3030/api/health
```

The potential responses from the health check endpoint are:

- `200 OK`: Both the API is functioning normally and a successful connection to the database was made.
- `503 Service Unavailable`: Either the API is not functioning or it couldn't establish a connection to the database.

The potential responses from the readiness check endpoint are:

- `200 OK`: The application is ready to serve traffic.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: The application received a SIGTERM or SIGINT and should not receive traffic.

Applications and monitoring services can call this endpoint periodically for health updates.

Per default, the Langfuse web healthcheck endpoint does not validate if the database is reachable, as there are cases where the
database is unavailable, but the application still serves traffic.
If you want to run database healthchecks, you can add `?failIfDatabaseUnavailable=true` to the healthcheck endpoint.

## OpenTelemetry

Langfuse uses OpenTelemetry to provide observability into the application.
If you want to include Langfuse into your own tracing setup, you can configure the following environment variables to send spans to your own collector:

| Variable                      | Required / Default      | Description                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | `http://localhost:4318` | The OTLP collector endpoint Langfuse should send traces to. Path is /v1/traces.                   |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`           | `web/worker`            | Name of the service within your APM tool.                                                         |
| `OTEL_TRACE_SAMPLING_RATIO`   | `1`                     | The sampling ratio for traces. A value of `1` means all traces are sent. Must be between 0 and 1. |

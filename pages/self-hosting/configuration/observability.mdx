# Observability via OpenTelemetry

Langfuse uses OpenTelemetry to provide observability into the application.
If you want to include Langfuse into your own tracing setup, you can configure the following environment variables to send spans to your own collector:

| Variable                      | Required / Default      | Description                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | `http://localhost:4318` | The OTLP collector endpoint Langfuse should send traces to. Path is /v1/traces.                   |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`           | `web/worker`            | Name of the service within your APM tool.                                                         |
| `OTEL_TRACE_SAMPLING_RATIO`   | `1`                     | The sampling ratio for traces. A value of `1` means all traces are sent. Must be between 0 and 1. |

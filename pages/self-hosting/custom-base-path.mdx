title: Custom Base Path (self-hosted)
description: Follow this guide to deploy Langfuse on a custom base path, e.g. https://yourdomain.com/langfuse.

# Custom Base Path

By default, Langfuse is served on the root path of a domain, e.g. `https://langfuse.yourdomain.com`, `https://yourdomain.com`.

In some circumstances, you might want to deploy Langfuse on a custom base path, e.g. `https://yourdomain.com/langfuse`, when integrating Langfuse into existing infrastructure.

## Setup

<Callout type="warning">
  As this base path is inlined in static assets, you cannot use the prebuilt
  docker image for the **web container** (langfuse/langfuse). **You need to
  build the image from source** with the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` environment
  variable set at build time. The worker container (langfuse/langfuse-worker)
  can be run with the prebuilt image.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Update environment variables

When using a custom base path, `NEXTAUTH_URL` must be set to the full URL including the base path and `/api/auth`. For example, if you are deploying Langfuse at `https://yourdomain.com/langfuse-base-path`, you need to set:

```bash filename=".env"
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH="/langfuse-base-path"
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://yourdomain.com/langfuse-base-path/api/auth"
```

### Build Langfuse Web image from source

Build image for the Langfuse Web container (`langfuse/langfuse`) from source with `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` as build argument:

```bash /NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH/
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git
cd langfuse

# checkout production branch
# main branch includes unreleased changes that might be unstable
git checkout production

# build image with NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH
docker build -t langfuse/langfuse --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/langfuse-base-path -f ./web/Dockerfile .
```

### Run Langfuse

When Deploying Langfuse according to one of the deployment guides, replace the prebuilt image for the web container (`langfuse/langfuse`) with the image you built from source.

### Connect to Langfuse

Once your Langfuse instance is running, you can access both the API and console through your configured custom base path. When connecting via SDKs, make sure to include the custom base path in the hostname.

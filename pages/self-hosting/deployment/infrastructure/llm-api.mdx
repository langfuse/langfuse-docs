# LLM API / Gateway

Optionally, you can configure Langfuse to use an external LLM API or gateway for add-on features. Langfuse tracing does not need access to the LLM API as traces are captured client-side.

## Supported LLM APIs

Langfuse supports:

- OpenAI
- Azure OpenAI
- Anthropic
- Google Vertex
- Amazon Bedrock

Via the OpenAI API, many other LLM services and proxies can be used.

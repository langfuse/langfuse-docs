title: Health and Readiness Check Endpoint

# Health and Readiness Check Endpoint

Langfuse web container includes a health check endpoint at `/api/public/health` and a readiness check endpoint at `/api/public/ready` and the
Langfuse worker container a health check endpoint at `/api/health`.
The health check endpoint indicates if the application is alive and the readiness check endpoint indicates if the application is ready to serve traffic.

Access the health and readiness check endpoints:

```bash
# langfuse-web
curl http://localhost:3000/api/public/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/public/ready

# langfuse-worker
curl http://localhost:3030/api/health
```

The potential responses from the health check endpoint are:

- `200 OK`: Both the API is functioning normally and a successful connection to the database was made.
- `503 Service Unavailable`: Either the API is not functioning or it couldn't establish a connection to the database.

The potential responses from the readiness check endpoint are:

- `200 OK`: The application is ready to serve traffic.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: The application received a SIGTERM or SIGINT and should not receive traffic.

Applications and monitoring services can call this endpoint periodically for health updates.

Per default, the Langfuse web healthcheck endpoint does not validate if the database is reachable, as there are cases where the
database is unavailable, but the application still serves traffic.
If you want to run database healthchecks, you can add `?failIfDatabaseUnavailable=true` to the healthcheck endpoint.

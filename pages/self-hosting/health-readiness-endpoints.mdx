# Health and Readiness Check Endpoints

Langfuse provides monitoring endpoints to check the health and readiness of your self-hosted deployment. These endpoints are essential for load balancers, orchestration systems, and monitoring tools.

## Overview

| Container           | Endpoint             | Purpose                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **langfuse-web**    | `/api/public/health` | Check if the web service is healthy                  |
| **langfuse-web**    | `/api/public/ready`  | Check if the web service is ready to receive traffic |
| **langfuse-worker** | `/api/health`        | Check if the worker service is healthy               |

## Health Check Endpoints

Health checks verify that the application is running and operational.

### Web Container Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/public/health
```

**Default Behavior:**

- By default, this endpoint only checks if the API is running
- It does **not** validate database connectivity to allow serving traffic even when the database is temporarily unavailable
- To include database connectivity in the health check, add the query parameter:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/public/health?failIfDatabaseUnavailable=true
  ```

**Response Codes:**

- `200 OK` - API is functioning normally (and database is reachable if parameter is used)
- `503 Service Unavailable` - API is not functioning or database is unreachable (when parameter is used)

### Worker Container Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:3030/api/health
```

**Response Codes:**

- `200 OK` - Worker service is functioning normally and database connection is successful
- `503 Service Unavailable` - Worker service is not functioning or cannot connect to the database

## Readiness Check Endpoint

The readiness check indicates whether the web application is ready to receive traffic, particularly useful during graceful shutdowns.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/public/ready
```

**Response Codes:**

- `200 OK` - Application is ready to serve traffic
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Application has received a shutdown signal (SIGTERM or SIGINT) and should not receive new traffic

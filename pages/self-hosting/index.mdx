The following options are available:

- Langfuse Cloud: A fully managed version of Langfuse that is hosted and maintained by the Langfuse team.
- Self-host Langfuse: Run Langfuse on your own infrastructure.
  - [Local](/self-hosting/local): Run Langfuse on your own machine in 5 minutes using Docker Compose.
  - [VM](/self-hosting/docker-compose): Run Langfuse on a single VM using Docker Compose.
  - [Docker](/self-hosting/docker)
  - [Kubernetes (Helm)](/self-hosting/kubernetes-helm): Run Langfuse on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.

## Architecture

Langfuse only depends on open source components and can be deployed locally, on cloud infrastructure, or on-premises.

import ArchitectureDiagram from "@/components-mdx/architecture-diagram.mdx";

<ArchitectureDiagram />

Langfuse consists of two application containers, storage components, and an optional LLM API/Gateway.

- [**Application Containers**](/self-hosting/infrastructure/containers)
  - Langfuse Web: The main web application serving the Langfuse UI and APIs.
  - Langfuse Worker: A worker that asynchronously processes events.
- **Storage Components**:
  - [Postgres](/self-hosting/infrastructure/postgres): The main database for transactional workloads.
  - [Redis/Valkey cache](/self-hosting/infrastructure/cache): A fast in-memory data structure store. Used for queue and cache operations.
  - [S3/Blob Store](/self-hosting/infrastructure/blobstorage): Object storage to persist all incoming events, multi-modal inputs, and large exports.
  - [Clickhouse](/self-hosting/infrastructure/clickhouse): High-performance OLAP database which stores traces, observations, and scores.
- [**LLM API / Gateway**](/self-hosting/infrastructure/llm-api): Some features depend on an external LLM API or gateway.

Langfuse can be deployed within a VPC or on-premises in high-security environments.
Internet access is optional.
See [networking](/self-hosting/networking) documentation for more details.

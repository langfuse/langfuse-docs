# Cache (Redis/Valkey)

<Callout type="info">

This is a deep dive into Redis/Valkey configuration. Follow one of the [deployment guides](/self-hosting#deployment-options) to get started.

</Callout>

Langfuse uses Redis/Valkey as a caching layer and queue.
It is used to accept new events quickly on the API and defer their processing and insertion.
This allows Langfuse to handle request peaks gracefully.

You can use a managed service on AWS, Azure, or GCP, or host it yourself.
At least version 7 is required and the instance must have `maxmemory-policy=noeviction` configured.

This guide covers how to configure Redis within Langfuse and what to keep in mind when bringing your own Redis.

## Configuration

Langfuse accepts the following environment variables to fine-tune your Redis usage.
They need to be provided for the Langfuse Web and Langfuse Worker containers.

| Variable                  | Required / Default | Description                                                                                        |
|---------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING` | Required           | Redis connection string with format `redis[s]://[[username][:password]@][host][:port][/db-number]` |

### Cache Configuration Options

Langfuse supports caching for API keys and prompts to improve performance. The following environment variables control caching behavior:

| Variable                             | Required / Default | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `LANGFUSE_CACHE_API_KEY_ENABLED`     | `true`             | Enable or disable API key caching. Set to `false` to disable caching of API keys. Plain-text keys are never stored in Redis, only hashed or encrypted keys. |
| `LANGFUSE_CACHE_API_KEY_TTL_SECONDS` | `300`              | Time-to-live (TTL) in seconds for cached API keys. Determines how long API keys remain in the cache before being refreshed.                                 |
| `LANGFUSE_CACHE_PROMPT_ENABLED`      | `true`             | Enable or disable prompt caching. Set to `false` to disable caching of prompts.                                                                             |
| `LANGFUSE_CACHE_PROMPT_TTL_SECONDS`  | `300`              | Time-to-live (TTL) in seconds for cached prompts. Determines how long prompts remain in the cache before being refreshed.                                   |

OR

| Variable                | Required / Default | Description                                                                                                             |
|-------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `REDIS_HOST`            | Required           | Redis host name.                                                                                                        |
| `REDIS_PORT`            | `6379`             | Port of the Redis instance.                                                                                             |
| `REDIS_USERNAME`        |                    | Username for Redis authentication.                                                                                      |
| `REDIS_AUTH`            |                    | Authentication string for the Redis instance.                                                                           |
| `REDIS_TLS_ENABLED`     | `false`            | Enable TLS for the Redis connection. Alternatively, enable tls via `rediss://` connection string.                       |
| `REDIS_TLS_CA_PATH`     |                    | Path to the CA certificate for the Redis connection.                                                                    |
| `REDIS_TLS_CERT_PATH`   |                    | Path to the certificate for the Redis connection.                                                                       |
| `REDIS_TLS_KEY_PATH`    |                    | Path to the private key for the Redis connection.                                                                       |
| `REDIS_KEY_PREFIX`      | ``                 | Optional prefix for all Redis keys to avoid key collisions with other applications. Should end with `:`.                |
| `REDIS_CLUSTER_ENABLED` | `false`            | Set to `true` to enable Redis cluster mode. When enabled, you must also provide `REDIS_CLUSTER_NODES`.                  |
| `REDIS_CLUSTER_NODES`   |                    | Comma-separated list of Redis cluster nodes in the format `host:port`. Required when `REDIS_CLUSTER_ENABLED` is `true`. |

## Deployment Options

This section covers different deployment options and provides example environment variables.

### Managed Redis/Valkey by Cloud Providers

[Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/de/elasticache/redis/), [Azure Cache for Redis](https://azure.microsoft.com/de-de/products/cache/), and [GCP Memorystore](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/?hl=en) are fully managed Redis services.
Langfuse handles failovers between read-replicas and supports Redis cluster mode for horizontal scaling.

For **standalone Redis instances**, use the standard configuration:
```bash
REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING=redis://username:password@your-redis-endpoint:6379
```

For **Redis cluster mode**, enable cluster support:
```bash
REDIS_CLUSTER_ENABLED=true
REDIS_CLUSTER_NODES=your-cluster-endpoint:6379
REDIS_AUTH=your-redis-password  # if authentication is enabled
```

Ensure that your Langfuse container can reach your Redis instance within the VPC.

<Callout type="warning">

You must set the parameter `maxmemory-policy` to `noeviction` to ensure that the queue jobs are not evicted from the cache.

</Callout>

### Redis on Kubernetes (Helm)

Bitnami offers Helm Charts for [Redis](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/redis) and [Valkey](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/valkey).
We use the Valkey chart as a dependency for [Langfuse K8s](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/clickhouse).
See [Langfuse on Kubernetes (Helm)](/self-hosting/kubernetes-helm) for more details on how to deploy Langfuse on Kubernetes.

#### Example Configuration

For a minimum production setup, we recommend to use the following values.yaml overwrites when deploying the Clickhouse Helm chart:

```yaml
valkey:
  deploy: true
  architecture: standalone
  primary:
    extraFlags:
      - "--maxmemory-policy noeviction" # Necessary to handle queue jobs correctly
  auth:
    password: changeme
```

Set the following environment variables to connect to your Redis instance:

```yaml
REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING=redis://default:changeme@<chart-name>-valkey-master:6379/0
```

### Docker

You can run Redis in a single [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) container.
As there is no redundancy, this is **not recommended for production workloads**.

#### Example Configuration

Start the container with

```bash
docker run --name redis \
  -p 6379:6379 \
  redis --requirepass myredissecret --maxmemory-policy noeviction
```

Set the following environment variables to connect to your Redis instance:

```yaml
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_AUTH=myredissecret
```

## Redis Cluster Mode

Redis cluster mode enables horizontal scaling by distributing data across multiple Redis nodes.
Langfuse supports Redis cluster mode for high-availability and increased throughput scenarios.

### Configuration

To enable Redis cluster mode, set the following environment variables:

```bash
REDIS_CLUSTER_ENABLED=true
REDIS_CLUSTER_NODES=redis-node1:6379,redis-node2:6379,redis-node3:6379,redis-node4:6379,redis-node5:6379,redis-node6:6379
REDIS_AUTH=your-redis-password  # if authentication is enabled
```

<Callout type="info">

For production deployments, we recommend using 3 master nodes with 1 replica each (6 nodes total) for high availability.

</Callout>

### Example Configurations

#### AWS ElastiCache Redis Cluster

```bash
REDIS_CLUSTER_ENABLED=true
REDIS_CLUSTER_NODES=clustercfg.my-redis-cluster.abc123.cache.amazonaws.com:6379
REDIS_AUTH=your-auth-token
REDIS_TLS_ENABLED=true
```

#### Self-hosted Redis Cluster

```bash
REDIS_CLUSTER_ENABLED=true
REDIS_CLUSTER_NODES=10.0.1.10:6379,10.0.1.11:6379,10.0.1.12:6379,10.0.1.13:6379,10.0.1.14:6379,10.0.1.15:6379
REDIS_AUTH=your-cluster-password
```

<Callout type="warning">

When using Redis cluster mode:
- Ensure all cluster nodes are accessible from your Langfuse containers
- Use the same authentication credentials across all cluster nodes
- Monitor cluster health and handle node failures appropriately
- Set `maxmemory-policy=noeviction` on all cluster nodes to prevent queue job eviction
- Set `LANGFUSE_INGESTION_QUEUE_SHARD_COUNT` to a positive integer to enable sharding of the ingestion queue across cluster nodes. We recommend 2-3x of your Redis shard.

</Callout>

## Sizing Recommendations

Langfuse uses Redis mainly for queuing event metadata that should be processed by the worker.
In most cases, the worker can process the queue quickly to keep events from piling up.
For every ~100000 events per minute we recommend about 1GB of memory for the Redis instance.

## Redis Permissions

Redis allows users to restrict the keys and commands that a given user can access [Redis ACL Docs](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/acl/).
Langfuse expects that the provided user has access to all keys and commands within the given database, i.e. the access control should be defined as `on ~* +@all`.

## Valkey vs Redis

[Valkey](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey) was created as an open source (BSD) alternative to Redis.
It is a drop-in replacement for Redis and is compatible with the Redis protocol.
According to the maintainers their major version 8.0.0 retains compatibility to Redis v7 in most instances.
We do not extensively test new Langfuse releases with Valkey, but have not encountered any issues in internal experiments using it.
Therefore, you can consider Valkey as an option, but you may hit compatibility issues in case its behaviour diverges from Redis.

# Containers

## Recommended sizing

For production environments, we recommend to use at least 2 CPUs and 4 GB of RAM for all containers.
You should have at least two instances of the Langfuse Web container for high availability.
For auto-scaling, we recommend to add instances once the CPU utilization exceeds 50% on either container.

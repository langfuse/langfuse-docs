# Application Containers

<Callout type="info">

This is a deep dive into the configuration of the application containers. Follow one of the [deployment guides](/self-hosting#deployment-options) to get started.

</Callout>

Langfuse uses Docker to containerize the application. The application is split into two containers:

- **Langfuse Web**: The web server that serves the Langfuse Console and API.
- **Langfuse Worker**: The worker that handles background tasks such as sending emails or processing events.

## Recommended sizing

For production environments, we recommend to use at least 2 CPUs and 4 GB of RAM for all containers.
You should have at least two instances of the Langfuse Web container for high availability.
For auto-scaling, we recommend to add instances once the CPU utilization exceeds 50% on either container.

## Node.js memory settings

The Node.js applications in Langfuse containers need to be configured with appropriate memory limits to operate efficiently. By default, Node.js uses a maximum heap size of 1.7 GiB, which may be less than the actual container memory allocation. For example, if your container has 4 GiB of memory allocated but Node.js is limited to 1.7 GiB, you may encounter memory issues.

To properly configure memory limits, set the `max-old-space-size` via the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable on both the Langfuse Web and Worker containers:

```bash filename=".env"
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=${var.memory}
```

## Build container from source [#build-from-source]

While we recommend using the prebuilt docker image, you can also build the image yourself from source.

```bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git
cd langfuse

# checkout production branch
# main branch includes unreleased changes that might be unstable
git checkout production

# build web image
docker build -t langfuse/langfuse -f ./web/Dockerfile .

# build worker image
docker build -t langfuse/langfuse-worker -f ./worker/Dockerfile .
```

# Containers

<Callout type="info">

This is a deep dive into the configuration of the application containers. Follow one of the [deployment guides](/self-hosting#deployment-options) to get started.

## Recommended sizing

For production environments, we recommend to use at least 2 CPUs and 4 GB of RAM for all containers.
You should have at least two instances of the Langfuse Web container for high availability.
For auto-scaling, we recommend to add instances once the CPU utilization exceeds 50% on either container.

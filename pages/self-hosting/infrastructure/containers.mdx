# Application Containers

<Callout type="info">

This is a deep dive into the configuration of the application containers. Follow one of the [deployment guides](/self-hosting#deployment-options) to get started.

</Callout>

Langfuse uses Docker to containerize the application. The application is split into two containers:

- **Langfuse Web**: The web server that serves the Langfuse Console and API.
- **Langfuse Worker**: The worker that handles background tasks such as sending emails or processing events.

## Recommended sizing

For production environments, we recommend to use at least 2 CPUs and 4 GB of RAM for all containers.
You should have at least two instances of the Langfuse Web container for high availability.
For auto-scaling, we recommend to add instances once the CPU utilization exceeds 50% on either container.

## Node.js memory settings

The Node.js applications in Langfuse containers need to be configured with appropriate memory limits to operate efficiently. By default, Node.js uses a maximum heap size of 1.7 GiB, which may be less than the actual container memory allocation. For example, if your container has 4 GiB of memory allocated but Node.js is limited to 1.7 GiB, you may encounter memory issues.

To properly configure memory limits, set the `max-old-space-size` via the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable on both the Langfuse Web and Worker containers:

```bash filename=".env"
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=${var.memory}
```

## Build container from source [#build-from-source]

While we recommend using the prebuilt docker image, you can also build the image yourself from source.

```bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git
cd langfuse

# checkout production branch
# main branch includes unreleased changes that might be unstable
git checkout production

# build web image
docker build -t langfuse/langfuse -f ./web/Dockerfile .

# build worker image
docker build -t langfuse/langfuse-worker -f ./worker/Dockerfile .
```

## Run Langfuse Web

See [configuration](/self-hosting/configuration) for more details on the environment variables.

```bash
docker run --name langfuse-web \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://hello \
  -e NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
  -e NEXTAUTH_SECRET=mysecret \
  -e SALT=mysalt \
  -e ENCRYPTION_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 \ # generate via: openssl rand -hex 32
  -e CLICKHOUSE_URL=http://clickhouse:8123 \
  -e CLICKHOUSE_USER=clickhouse \
  -e CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=clickhouse \
  -e CLICKHOUSE_MIGRATION_URL=clickhouse://clickhouse:9000 \
  -e REDIS_HOST=localhost \
  -e REDIS_PORT=6379 \
  -e REDIS_AUTH=redis \
  -e LANGFUSE_S3_EVENT_UPLOAD_BUCKET=my-bucket \
  -e LANGFUSE_S3_EVENT_UPLOAD_REGION=us-east-1 \
  -e LANGFUSE_S3_EVENT_UPLOAD_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE \
  -e LANGFUSE_S3_EVENT_UPLOAD_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -a STDOUT \
langfuse/langfuse:3
```

## Run Langfuse Worker

See [configuration](/self-hosting/configuration) for more details on the environment variables.

```bash
docker run --name langfuse-worker \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://hello \
  -e NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
  -e SALT=mysalt \
  -e ENCRYPTION_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 \ # generate via: openssl rand -hex 32
  -e CLICKHOUSE_URL=http://clickhouse:8123 \
  -e CLICKHOUSE_USER=clickhouse \
  -e CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=clickhouse \
  -e REDIS_HOST=localhost \
  -e REDIS_PORT=6379 \
  -e REDIS_AUTH=redis \
  -e LANGFUSE_S3_EVENT_UPLOAD_BUCKET=my-bucket \

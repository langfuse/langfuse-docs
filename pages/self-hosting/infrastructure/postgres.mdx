# Postgres Database

<Callout type="info">

Follow one of the [deployment guides](/self-hosting#deployment-options) to get started.

</Callout>

Langfuse requires a persistent Postgres database to store its state.
You can use a managed service on AWS, Azure, or GCP, or host it yourself.

Langfuse supports Postgres versions >= 12 and uses the `public` schema in the selected database.

## Use Cases

Postgres is used for all transactional data, including:

- Users
- Organizations
- Projects
- Datasets
- Encrypted API keys
- Settings

## Configuration

### Timezones

Langfuse expects that its infrastructure components default to UTC.
Especially Postgres and ClickHouse settings that overwrite the UTC default are not supported and may lead to unexpected behavior.
Please vote on this [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/5046) if you would like us to consider supporting other timezones.

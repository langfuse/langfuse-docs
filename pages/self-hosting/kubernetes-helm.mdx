# Kubernetes (Helm)

This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy Langfuse on Kubernetes using the Helm package manager.
You will need access to a Kubernetes cluster and Helm installed on your local machine.
For the purposes of this guide, we will use a local minikube instance, but each step should extend to a managed Kubernetes service like GKE, EKS, or AKS.

By default, the chart will deploy the Langfuse application containers and data stores ([architecture overview](/self-hosting#architecture)). You can optionally point to an existing PostgreSQL, Clickhouse and Redis instance. See [Readme](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-k8s/blob/lfe-1348-v3-chart/README.md) for more details.

Planned: Cloud-specific deployment guides, please upvote and comment on the following threads: [AWS](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/4645), [Google Cloud](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/4646),[Azure](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/4647).

## Fetch the Helm chart and customize values

Fetch the `langfuse-k8s` GitHub repository to your local machine to install using Helm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-k8s.git

cd langfuse-k8s/charts/langfuse
```

Checkout the `lfe-1348-v3-chart` branch. This will be merged on Dec 9, 2024.

```bash
git checkout lfe-1348-v3-chart
```

For local experimentation, the pre-configured variables in the values.yaml file are usually sufficient.

If you send _any_ kind of sensitive data to the application or intend to keep it up for longer, we recommend that
you modify the values.yaml file and overwrite the following environment variables using the `additionalEnv` field:

- `SALT`: A random string used to hash passwords. It should be at least 32 characters long.
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY`: Generate this via `openssl rand -base64 32`.
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: A random string used to sign JWT tokens.
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: The URL where the application is hosted. Used for redirects after signup.

In addition, you can change the database and storage credentials to be more secure.

For a comprehensive overview of all available environment variables and configuration options, please refer to the [configuration guide](/self-hosting/configuration).

## Deploy the helm chart

Create a new namespace for the Langfuse deployment, e.g.:

```bash
kubectl create namespace langfuse-v3-preview
```

Download the Helm chart dependencies:

```bash
helm dependency update
```

Install the Helm chart to our demo namespace:

```bash
helm install langfuse . -n langfuse-v3-preview
```

Our chart assumes that it's installed as `langfuse`.
If you want to install it with a different name, you will have to adjust the Redis hostname in the `values.yaml` accordingly.

At this point, Kubernetes will start to deploy the Langfuse application and its dependencies.
This can take up to 5 minutes.
You can monitor the progress by checking `kubectl get pods -n langfuse-v3-preview` - we expect all pods to be running eventually.
The langfuse-web and langfuse-worker container will restart a couple of times while the databases are being provisioned.

## Smoke test UI

The Langfuse UI will be served on a NodePort service.
Use `kubectl get services -n langfuse-v3-preview` and search for `langfuse-web` to see the port mapping.
You can access the Langfuse UI by visiting `http://<minikube-ip>:<nodeport>` in your browser.
Go ahead and register, create a new organization, project, and explore Langfuse.

## Features

Langfuse supports many configuration options and self-hosted features.
For more details, please refer to the [configuration guide](/self-hosting/configuration).

import SelfHostFeatures from "@/components-mdx/self-host-features.mdx";

<SelfHostFeatures />

## Shutdown

You can delete the Helm release and the namespace to clean up the resources:

```bash
helm uninstall langfuse -n langfuse-v3-preview
kubectl delete namespace langfuse-v3-preview
```

## How to Upgrade

Run the following commands to upgrade the Helm chart to the latest version:

```bash
helm dependency update
helm upgrade langfuse . -n langfuse-v3-preview
```

For more details on upgrading, please refer to the [upgrade guide](/self-hosting/upgrade).

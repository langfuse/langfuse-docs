# Enterprise License Key

All core Langfuse features and APIs are available in Langfuse OSS (MIT licensed) without any limits.

When running Langfuse self-hosted, you use the same deployment infrastructure as Langfuse Cloud. There are no scalability limitations between the different versions.

Some additional Enterprise features require a license key:

- [Project-level RBAC roles](/docs/rbac)
- [Data Retention Policies](/docs/data-retention)
- [Audit Logs](/changelog/2025-01-21-audit-logs)
- [UI Customization](/self-hosting/administration/ui-customization)
- [Organization Creators](/self-hosting/administration/organization-creators)
- [Organization Management API](/self-hosting/administration/organization-management-api)

See [pricing page](/pricing-self-host) for more details on Langfuse Enterprise.

## Activating a License Key

After purchasing a license key, you can activate it by adding the following environment variable to your Langfuse deployment (both langfuse containers):

```bash
LANGFUSE_EE_LICENSE_KEY=<your-license-key>
```

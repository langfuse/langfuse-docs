# Run Langfuse Locally

This guide will walk you through the steps to run Langfuse locally via docker compose.
We will use the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file.
This is the simplest way to run Langfuse to give it a try.

For high-availability and high-throughput, we recommend using Kubernetes ([deployment guide](/self-hosting/kubernetes-helm)).
The docker compose setup lacks high-availability, scaling capabilities, and backup functionality.

## Walkthrough

Watch this 2:15 minute walkthrough for a step-by-step guide on running Langfuse locally with Docker Compose.

## Get Started

Requirements:

- git
- docker & docker compose -> use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) on Mac or Windows

<Steps>

### Clone Langfuse Repository

Get a copy of the latest Langfuse repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git
cd langfuse
```

### Start the application

Run the langfuse docker compose

```bash
docker compose up
```

Watch the containers being started and the logs flowing in.
After about 2-3 minutes, the langfuse-web-1 container should log "Ready".
At this point you can proceed to the next step.

### Done

And you are ready to go! Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the Langfuse UI.

</Steps>

## Features

Langfuse supports many configuration options and self-hosted features.
For more details, please refer to the [configuration guide](/self-hosting/configuration).

import SelfHostFeatures from "@/components-mdx/self-host-features.mdx";

<SelfHostFeatures />

## Shutdown

You can stop the containers by hitting `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

If you started docker-compose in the background (`-d` flag), you can stop all instance using:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Adding the `-v` flag will also remove the volumes.

## How to Upgrade

To upgrade Langfuse, you can stop the containers and run `docker compose up --pull always`.

For more details on upgrading, please refer to the [upgrade guide](/self-hosting/upgrade).

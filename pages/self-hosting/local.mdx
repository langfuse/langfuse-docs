# Local (Docker Compose)

This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy Langfuse via Docker Compose on your local machine.
We assume that you have git, docker, and docker compose installed.
This setup is intended for development and **not recommended for production**.

## Clone Langfuse Repository

Get a copy of the latest Langfuse repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git
cd langfuse
```

## Start the application

Run the docker compose file for Langfuse v3:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Watch the containers being started and the logs flowing in.
After about 2-3 minutes, the langfuse-web-1 container should log "Ready".
At this point you can proceed to the next step.

## Smoke test UI

You should be able to load the Langfuse UI, by opening `http://<instance-ip>:3000/` in your browser.
Go ahead and register, create a new organization, project, and explore Langfuse.

## Shutdown

You can stop the containers by hitting `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
If you started docker-compose in the background (`-d` flag), you can stop all instance using:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Adding the `-v` flag will also remove the volumes.

Ensure to stop the VM instance in your cloud provider interface to avoid unnecessary costs.

## How to Upgrade

To upgrade Langfuse, you can stop all instances and run `docker compose up --pull always`.

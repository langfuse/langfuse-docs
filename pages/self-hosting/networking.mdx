# Networking

Langfuse can be deployed in a VPC or on-premises in high-security environments. This guide covers the networking requirements and considerations.

## Network Exposure & Service Configuration

Only the `langfuse/langfuse` (web) container needs to be accessible by users, via API, and SDKs.
Optionally, this can be behind a firewall, proxy, or VPN.

By default `PORT=3000` is used for the Langfuse Web container. This can be configured using the `PORT` environment variable ([docs](/self-hosting/configuration)). Usually a network load balancer is used to expose the service and handle ssl termination ([docs](/self-hosting/encryption)).

Langfuse is designed to be exposed publicly as a web service.
This is penetration tested and secure by design as the Langfuse Team runs the same container for the managed Langfuse Cloud Offering.
See [security documentation](/security) of Langfuse Cloud for more details.

## Internet Access

Langfuse does not require internet access.

Some optional components, like the LLM Playground and LLM-evals require access to an [LLM API/Gateway](/self-hosting/infrastructure/llm-api).
This can be deployed in the same VPC or peered with the VPC.

Langfuse pings a cached version of the GitHub API to check for updates to the Langfuse Server. If internet access is not available, this check will fail gracefully.

# Networking

Langfuse can be deployed in a VPC or on-premises in high-security environments.
Only the Langfuse web container needs to be accessible by users, via API, and SDKs.
Optionally, this can be behind a firewall, proxy, or VPN.
Langfuse can be run without internet access and the optional LLM API/Gateway can be deployed in the same VPC or peered with the VPC.

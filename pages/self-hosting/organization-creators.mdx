By default, all users who have access to a Langfuse instance can create new organizations.

If you want to restrict organization creation to a specific set of users, you can use the `LANGFUSE_ALLOWED_ORGANIZATION_CREATORS` environment variable. In some organizations, there is a certain set of users who create new organizations and then provision access to the single organization or project via [RBAC](/docs/rbac).

```bash filename=".env"
LANGFUSE_ALLOWED_ORGANIZATION_CREATORS=user1@langfuse.com,user2@langfuse.com
```

If you have specific requirements and wonder how to best managed this, please reach out to us at [support@langfuse.com](mailto:support@langfuse.com). We are happy to help!

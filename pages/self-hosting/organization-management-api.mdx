# Organization Management API

<Callout type="info">

  This is only available on self-hosted Langfuse deployments.
  You must configure the `ADMIN_API_KEY` environment variable and add `Bearer ADMIN_API_KEY` as the `Authorization` header to your requests.

</Callout>

## Overview

The Organization Management API allows administrators to programmatically manage organizations in a self-hosted Langfuse instance.
This API is not available on Langfuse Cloud.

## Authentication

Authenticate with the API by setting the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_API_KEY
```

Where `$ADMIN_API_KEY` is the value set in your environment configuration.

## API Reference

The API provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting organizations.
In addition, you can create, list, and delete API keys with an organization scope.
Those can be used to authenticate with the Langfuse API and use management routes for projects and users ([Admin API](/docs/admin-api)).

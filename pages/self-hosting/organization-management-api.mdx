## Overview

This API is not available on Langfuse Cloud.

## Authentication

<Steps>

### Configure an `ADMIN_API_KEY`

Configure an `ADMIN_API_KEY` in your environment configuration:

```bash filename="Environment"
ADMIN_API_KEY=your-admin-api-key
```

### Authenticate with the API

Then, authenticate with the API by setting the Authorization header:

## API Reference

The API provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting organizations.
In addition, you can create, list, and delete API keys with an organization scope.
Those can be used to authenticate with the Langfuse API and use management routes for projects and users ([Admin API](/docs/admin-api)).

# Scaling

This guide covers how you can operate your Langfuse deployment at scale and includes best practices and tweaks to get the best performance.

## Ingestion Throughput

Langfuse is designed to handle a large amount and volume of ingested data.
On very high loads, it may become necessary to apply additional settings that influence the throughput.

### Scaling the worker containers

For most environments, we recommend to scale the worker containers by their CPU load as this is a straightforward metric to measure.
A load above 50% for a 2 CPU container is an indicator that the instance is saturated and that the throughput should increase by adding more containers.

In addition, the Langfuse worker also publishes queue length metrics via statsd that can be used to scale the worker containers.
`langfuse.queue.ingestion.length` is the main metric that we use to make scaling decisions.
The queue metrics can also be published to AWS CloudWatch by setting `ENABLE_AWS_CLOUDWATCH_METRIC_PUBLISHING=true` to configure auto-scalers based on AWS metrics.

### Reducing ClickHouse reads within the ingestion processing

Per default, the Langfuse worker reads the existing event from ClickHouse and merges it with any incoming data.
This increases the load on ClickHouse and may limit the total throughput.
For projects that were not migrated from a previous version of Langfuse, this is optional as the full event history is available in S3.
You can set `LANGFUSE_SKIP_INGESTION_CLICKHOUSE_READ_MIN_PROJECT_CREATE_DATE` to a date in the past before your first project was created, e.g. `2025-01-01`.
Please note that any S3/blob storage deletion lifecycle rules in combination with late updates to events may cause duplicates in the event history.
If you use the default integration methods with the Langfuse SDKs or OpenTelemetry this should not affect you.

### Separating ingestion and user interface

When the ingestion load is high, the Langfuse web interface and API calls may become slow or unresponsive.
In this case, splitting the langfuse-web deployment into one ingestion handling and one user interface handling deployment can help to keep the user interface responsive.
You can create a new identical replica of the langfuse-web deployment and route all traffic to `/api/public/ingestion*`, `/api/public/media*`, and `/api/public/otel*` to the new deployment.

## Slow UI queries or API calls

If you notice long-loading screens within the UI or slow API calls, it is usually related to insufficient resources on the ClickHouse database or missing time filters.
The tracing data is indexed by projectId and time, i.e. adding filter conditions on those should significantly improve performance.

If all filters are in place, a larger ClickHouse instance may increase the observed performance.
ClickHouse is designed to scale vertically, i.e. adding more memory to the instance should yield faster response times.
You can check the [ClickHouse Docs](https://clickhouse.com/docs/operations/tips#using-less-than-16gb-of-ram) on which memory size to choose for your workloads.
In general, we recommend at least 16 GiB of memory for larger deployments.

## Increasing Disk Usage

LLM tracing data may contain large payloads due to inputs and outputs being tracked.
In addition, ClickHouse stores observability data within its system tables.
If you notice that your disk space is increasing significantly on S3/Blob Storage or ClickHouse, we can recommend the following.

In general, the most effective way to free disk space is to configure a [data retention](/docs/data-retention) policy.
If this is not available in your plan, consider the options below.

### S3 / Blob Storage Disk Usage

You can implement lifecycle rules to automatically remove old files from your blob storage.
We recommend to keep events for as long as you want to access them within the UI or you want to update them.
For most customers, a default of 30 days is a good choice.

### ClickHouse Disk Usage

To automatically remove data within ClickHouse, you can use the [TTL](https://clickhouse.com/docs/guides/developer/ttl) feature.
See the ClickHouse documentation for more details on how to configure it.
This is applicable for the `traces`, `observations`, `scores`, and `event_log` table within ClickHouse.

In addition, the `system.trace_log` and `system.text_log` tables within ClickHouse may grow large, even on smaller deployments.
You can modify your ClickHouse settings to set a TTL on both tables.
It is also safe to manually prune them from time to time.
Check the [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings#trace_log) for details on how to configure a TTL on those tables.

# Transactional Email

Optionally, you can configure an SMTP server to send transactional emails.
These are used for password resets, project/organization invitations, and notifications when a batch export is completed.

## Configuration

To enable transactional emails, set the following environment variables on the application containers:

| Variable              | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SMTP_CONNECTION_URL` | Configure optional SMTP server connection for transactional email. Connection URL is passed to Nodemailer ([docs](https://nodemailer.com/smtp)). |
| `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`  | Configure from address for transactional email. Required if `SMTP_CONNECTION_URL` is set.                                                        |

## FAQ

- **Which SMTP service to use?** It is recommended to use a reputable SMTP service for transactional emails to ensure delivery and prevent abuse. If you do not have a preferred service from your cloud provider, try [Resend](https://resend.com/) or [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/). Both are easy to set up and have generous free tiers.
- **Can I use my private inbox?** No, private inboxes (like GMail) are generally not recommended and difficult to configure correctly.

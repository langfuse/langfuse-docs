# Migrate Langfuse v1 to v2

Langfuse v2 ([released](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/releases/tag/v2.0.0) Jan 30, 2024) is a major release of Langfuse that introduces a rebuilt usage and cost tracking system for LLM generations. The update requires running a one-off migration script on historical data to ensure accurate LLM costs of existing traces.

## Changes

### What has changed?

- Completely rebuilt usage/cost tracking system for LLM generations
- New model definition abstraction that enables:
  - Quick support for new emerging models
  - Tracking of model price changes over time
  - Custom models/prices at the project level
- Added ability to set usage and cost via API when ingesting traces
- Usage and cost information available on all UI tables and APIs

### What has not changed?

Everything else, including APIs and infrastructure components, remains the same. No breaking changes.

## Who needs to take action during the upgrade?

- **No action required** if you:

  - Use Langfuse Cloud
  - Only care about newly ingested traces
  - Don't use the cost tracking features

- **Action required** if you:
  - Self-host Langfuse
  - Want accurate cost data for historical traces

## Migration Steps

<Callout type="info">
  This process is non-blocking and does not impact the availability of your

<Steps>

### Update Langfuse to v2

Follow the deployment guide to upgrade your Langfuse deployment to v2.

- For production deployments, see the [upgrade guide](/self-hosting/v2/deployment-guide#update)
- If you use docker compose, see the [upgrade guide](/self-hosting/v2/docker-compose)

### Apply new model logic and prices to existing data

Langfuse includes a list of supported models for [usage and cost tracking](/docs/model-usage-and-cost). If a Langfuse update includes support for new models, these will only be applied to newly ingested traces/generations.

Optionally, you can apply the new model definitions to existing data using the following steps. During the migration, the database remains available (non-blocking).

1. Clone the repository and create an `.env` file:

   ```bash
   # Clone the Langfuse repository
   git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git

   # Navigate to the Langfuse directory
   cd langfuse

   # Install all dependencies
   pnpm i

   # Create an .env file
   cp .env.dev.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` to connect to your database from your machine:

   ```bash filename=".env"
   NODE_ENV=production

   # Replace with your database connection string
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
   ```

3. Execute the migration. Depending on the size of your database, this might take a while.

   ```bash
   pnpm run models:migrate
   ```

4. Clean up: remove the `.env` file to avoid connecting to the production database from your local machine.

</Steps>

## Support

If you experience any issues, please create an [issue on GitHub](/issues) or contact the maintainers ([support](/support)).

For support with production deployments, the Langfuse team provides dedicated enterprise support. To learn more, reach out to enterprise@langfuse.com or [schedule a demo](/schedule-demo).

Alternatively, you may consider using [Langfuse Cloud](/docs/deployment/cloud), which is a fully managed version of Langfuse. You can find information about its security and privacy [here](/docs/data-security-privacy).

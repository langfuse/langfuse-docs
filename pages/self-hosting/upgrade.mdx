# Upgrade

Langfuse is compatible between all minor releases within the same major version.
You can automatically use the latest version of a major release by using `langfuse/langfuse:3` and `langfuse/langfuse-worker:3` as the image tags in your deployment.

If you upgrade between major versions, please follow our migration guide for

- [v2.x.x to v3.x.x](/self-hosting/upgrade-v2-to-v3)

To update deployments, follow the update section in our deployment guides:

- [Local](/self-hosting/local#how-to-upgrade)
- [VM](/self-hosting/docker-compose#how-to-upgrade)
- [Docker](/self-hosting/docker#how-to-upgrade)
- [Kubernetes (Helm)](/self-hosting/kubernetes-helm#how-to-upgrade)

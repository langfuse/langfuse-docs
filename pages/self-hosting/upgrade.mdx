# Upgrading a Self-Hosted Langfuse Deployment

Langfuse evolves quickly ([changelog](/changelog)) and keeping your deployment up to date is key to benefit from security, performance, and feature updates.

The Langfuse versioning and upgrade process is optimized for minimal complexity and disruption. If you ever experience any issues, please create an [issue on GitHub](/issues) or contact the maintainers ([support](/support)).

## How to upgrade

<Callout type="info">

It is recommended to be familiar with our [versioning](/self-hosting/versioning) policy before upgrading existing deployments.

</Callout>

### Minor/Patch Versions

Updates within a major version are designed to be non-disruptive and are automatically applied. On start of the application, all migrations are automatically applied to the databases.

You can automatically use the latest version of a major release by using `langfuse/langfuse:3` and `langfuse/langfuse-worker:3` as the image tags in your deployment.

To update deployments, follow the update section in our deployment guides:

- [Local](/self-hosting/local#how-to-upgrade)
- [VM](/self-hosting/docker-compose#how-to-upgrade)
- [Docker](/self-hosting/docker#how-to-upgrade)
- [Kubernetes (Helm)](/self-hosting/kubernetes-helm#how-to-upgrade)

### Major Versions

If you upgrade between major versions, please follow our migration guides:

- [v2.x.x to v3.x.x](/self-hosting/upgrade-guides/upgrade-v2-to-v3)
- [v1.x.x to v2.x.x](/self-hosting/upgrade-guides/upgrade-v1-to-v2)

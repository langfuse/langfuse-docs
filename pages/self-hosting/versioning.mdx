# Versioning

Versioning is key to ensure compatibility between Langfuse Server, SDKs, and custom integrations via the Public API. Thus, we take [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) seriously.

## Scope of semantic versioning

The following changes **result in a major version bump** as they are considered breaking:

- Infrastructure changes
- Removal of existing Public APIs or removal/changes of existing parameters from Public APIs

The following changes **do not result in a major version bump** as they are considered internal implementation details:

- Database schemas
- Frontend APIs

## Compatibility between Langfuse Server and SDKs

Langfuse Server and SDKs are versioned independently to allow for more flexibility in upgrading components:

- **Server**: Can be upgraded independently of SDK versions, unless explicitly noted in release notes
- **SDKs**: Can remain on older versions while running newer server versions
- **Compatibility**: New SDK features may require recent server versions

We recommend keeping the Langfuse Server up to date to ensure access to all features and security updates.

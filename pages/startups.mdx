# Langfuse for Startups 🚀

Building with LLMs is chaotic enough. Observability pricing shouldn’t add to the stress.  
If your team is just getting started, **enjoy 50 % off your entire Langfuse bill for 12 months**.

> **TL;DR**  
> Early-stage startup? Bootstrapped or < $3 m raised? [Fill in the form](https://forms.gle/eJAYjRWeCZU1Mn6j8), get approved, and the discount
> is automatically applied to every invoice for a full year. [Apply here](https://forms.gle/eJAYjRWeCZU1Mn6j8).

## Why we do this

We were a scrappy two-person team once, too. The early days are about finding
product-market fit, not watching your cloud bill spiral. This program makes
enterprise-grade LLM observability affordable until you’re ready to scale.

# Support at Langfuse

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info">
  We are approachable and offer many other ways to provide support. If your
  request is not sensitive, please consider posting it on GitHub Discussions so
  that other users can benefit from its resolution.
</Callout>

We strive to offer comprehensive information and support through public, indexed, and searchable channels. As such, we prefer interacting via our documentation and GitHub Discussions.

## Preferred Support Channels

- [Documentation](/docs): Our documentation is the best place to start looking for answers. It is comprehensive, and we invest significant time in maintaining it. If you cannot find the answer to a common question there, please raise it through a different channel. We aim to include queries in our docs after we've answered them through other channels.
- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions): GitHub Discussions is our preferred channel for providing support and taking feature requests and feedback. It is an active forum, and we aim to respond to every inquiry within one working day.
- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/issues): For bugs and errors, please include a reproducible code example or screenshot when you open an issue.

## 1:1 Support

- Chat: You can use the Chat Widget from any page within the Langfuse Website and app. We will aim to get back to you quickly, usually within one business day.
- Email: You can reach us at support@langfuse.com. We aim to respond within two business days.
- [Schedule a Call](/schedule-demo): For sales or partnerships inquiries, you can book a call with one of the founders. Please provide a little context about why you'd like to speak.

## Community Support

- [Discord](/discord): We've grown a community of ~1,000 members on Discord. We use Discord for **community support**, which means our users can communicate with each other, and we participate as well. However, we follow Discord less closely than our preferred support channels. If you have an urgent or important question, please raise it on GitHub. You can then reference the GitHub Discussion in Discord.

# Support at Langfuse

<Callout type="info">
  Langfuse is an open-source project and we are building in public. We love
  feedback as the project and space develops quickly. We strive to offer
  comprehensive information and support through public, indexed, and searchable
  channels. If your request is not sensitive, please use our [GitHub Discussions](/gh-support).
</Callout>

## Finding an answer to your question

- Our [documentation](/docs) is the best place to start looking for answers. It is comprehensive, and we invest significant time into maintaining it. You can also suggest edits to the docs via GitHub.
- [Langfuse FAQs](/faq) on our website answer specific questions in more detail than the documentation can

## Support Channels

- [Request a feature](/ideas) on GitHub Discussions.
- [Report a Bug](/issues) on GitHub Issues.
- For time-sensitive queries you may use our in-app chat widget.

## Community Discord

- [Discord](/discord): Over 1,000 users are on our Discord Server. It's a great place to ask questions, share your projects, and get to know other Langfuse users. Please note: The Langfuse team does not provide dedicated support on Discord. Please use our [GitHub Discussions](/ideas) or Email (support@langfuse.com) if your request is sensitive. Feel free to cross-post from GitHub to Discord but please include a link to GitHub.

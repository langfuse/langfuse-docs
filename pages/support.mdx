We can help teams get value from Langfuse quickly:

## Security Assessment

We maintain a comprehensive set of internal [security policies and documentation](/security) that address key requirements for GDPR, SOC 2, and HIPAA compliance.

For Enterprise customers, we are glad to support your security assessment process. This may involve empowering your internal team (who retain responsibility for information security when self-hosting), or responding to your questions and updating our policies as needed.

Please check out the [security and compliance overview](/security) for more details.

# Support at Langfuse

<Callout type="info">
  Langfuse is an open-source project and we are building in public. We love
  feedback as the project and space develops quickly. We strive to offer
  comprehensive information and support through public, indexed, and searchable
  channels. If your request is not sensitive, please use [GitHub
  Discussions](/gh-support).
</Callout>

## Support Channels

- **Ask any question in our [public Q&A](/gh-support) on GitHub Discussions.** Please include as much detail as possible (e.g. code snippets, screenshots, background information) to help us understand your question.
- [Request a feature](/ideas) on GitHub Discussions.
- [Report a Bug](/issues) on GitHub Issues.
- For time-sensitive queries, ping us via the in-app chat widget.

## Finding an answer to your question

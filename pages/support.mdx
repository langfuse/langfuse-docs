# Support at Langfuse

<Callout type="info">
  Langfuse is an open-source project and we are building in public. We love
  feedback as the project and space develops quickly. We strive to offer
  comprehensive information and support through public, indexed, and searchable
  channels. If your request is not sensitive, please use [GitHub
  Discussions](/gh-support).

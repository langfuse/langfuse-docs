## Support at Langfuse

We try to provide as much information and support as possible in public, indexed and searchable ways. As such we prefer interacting via our documentation and GitHub Discussions.

### Preferred Support Channels

- [Documentation](/docs): Our docs are the best place to start looking for answers. They are comprehensive and we invest a bunch of time in them. If you cannot find the answer to a common question there, please raise it through a different channel. We aim to include queries in our docs after we've answered them through other channels.
- [Github Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions): GitHub Discussions is our preferred channel for providing support and taking feature requests and feedback. You will see it is an active forum and we aim to respond to every inquiry within one working day.
- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/issues): For bugs and errors - please include a reproducible code example or screenshot when you open an issue.
 

### 1:1 Support

- Chat: You can use the Chat Widget from any page within the Langfuse Website and app. We will aim to get back to you very quickly and usually within one business day.
- Email: You can reach us via support@langfuse.com. We aim to get back to you within two business days.
- [Schedule a Call](/demo): For sales or partnerships enquiries you can book a call with one of the founders here. Please provide a little bit of context as to why you'd like to speak.

### Community Support

- [Discord](/discord): We've grown a community of ~1.000 on Discord. We use Discord for **community support** which means our users can communicate with each other and we hang out there, too. We follow Discord less closely than our preferred support channels. If you have an urgent or important question, please raise it on GitHub. You can then reference the Github Discussion in Discord.

# Support at Langfuse

<Callout type="info">
  Langfuse is an open-source project and we are building in public. We love
  feedback as the project and space develops quickly. We strive to offer
  comprehensive information and support through public, indexed, and searchable
  channels. If your request is not sensitive, please use [GitHub
  Discussions](/gh-support).
</Callout>

## Finding an answer to your question

- Our [documentation](/docs) is the best place to start looking for answers. It is comprehensive, and we invest significant time into maintaining it. You can also suggest edits to the docs via GitHub.
- Use "Ask AI" to get instant answers to your questions:

import InkeepEmbeddedChat from "@/components/inkeep/InkeepEmbeddedChat";

<div className="h-5" />

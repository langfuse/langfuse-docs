We've been busy this month at **Langfuse**! From a fresh UI redesign to major feature rollouts, here's a summary of the highlights:

## 💫 UI Redesign

  Redesign](/images/blog/2025-03-31-langfuse-march-update/new-ui.gif)
</Frame>

In the last few weeks, we've revamped the Trace and Prompt views. We love the new look as it makes the pages cleaner, simplifies navigation, includes more data, and speeds up navigation when going through a lot of data.

→ [Explore the new design](https://cloud.langfuse.com/)

## 🧩 Prompt Composability

This was one of the most requested features: you can now reuse prompts in other prompts, letting you organize prompts in a modular way.

For example, create a shared "guidelines" prompt and use it across all of your prompts. When guidelines are updated, all of your dependent prompts will be updated.

→ Check out the end-to-end demo [here](https://langfuse.com/changelog/2025-03-12-prompt-composability).

## 🗃️ Environments

Langfuse is all about closing the loop between production and development to iterate quickly. That's why we introduced Environments, allowing you to separate environments (e.g. production, staging, dev) in Langfuse Tracing without needing to use tags or projects.

This enables you to share prompts, datasets, and more within a project without mixing the source of your tracing data.

→ Learn how to set this up in our [docs](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing-features/environments).

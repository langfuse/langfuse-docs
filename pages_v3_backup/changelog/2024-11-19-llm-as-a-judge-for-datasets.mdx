## Introduction

Building reliable AI applications is challenging because it's hard to understand how changes impact performance. Without proper evaluation, teams end up playing whack-a-mole with bugs and regressions. [Datasets and experiments](/docs/datasets/overview) in Langfuse help transform this uncertainty into a structured engineering process.

<details>
<summary>Benefits of investing into datasets and development evaluations</summary>

- Measure the impact of changes before deployment
- Identify regressions early
- Compare specific dataset items across different runs using reliable scores
- Build stronger conviction in your test datasets by identifying gaps between test and production evaluations
- Create reliable feedback loops for development

</details>

Until now, datasets and experiments depended on custom evaluations that were added to the run via the SDKs/API. This is great if you need full flexibility or want to use your preferred evaluation library or scoring logic. There were LLM-as-a-judge evaluators, but they were _limited to production runs_ and _could not access the ground truth of your dataset_ (`expected_output`) which is necessary for a reliable offline evaluation.

## What's new?

**Day 2 of [Launch Week 2](/blog/2024-11-17-launch-week-2) brings managed LLM-as-a-judge evaluators to dataset experiments.** Assign evaluators to your datasets and they will automatically run on new experiment runs, scoring your outputs based on your evaluation criteria.

You can run any LLM-as-a-judge prompt, Langfuse comes with templates for the following evaluation criteria: Hallucination, Helpfulness, Relevance, Toxicity, Correctness, Contextrelevance, Contextcorrectness, Conciseness

Langfuse LLM-as-a-judge _works with any LLM that supports tool/function calling_ that is accessible via the following APIs: OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock. Via LLM gateways such as LiteLLM, virtually any popular LLM can be used via the OpenAI connector.

## How it works

<Steps>

### Set up your LLM-as-a-judge evaluator

Evaluators in Langfuse consist of:

- **Dataset**: Select which test examples (production cases, synthetic data, or manual tests) your evaluator should run on
- **Prompt**: The prompt you want to use for evaluation including mapping variables from your dataset items to prompt variables
- **Scoring**: A custom score name and comment format you'd like the LLM evaluator to produce
- **Metadata**: Sampling rates to control costs, and delay to steer delay after running your experiment

Learn more about LLM-as-a-judge evaluators in our [evaluation documentation](/docs/scores/model-based-evals).

### Run experiments

Iterate on your application (prompts, model configuration, retrieval/application logic, etc.) and run an experiment via the Langfuse SDKs.

Learn more in our [datasets & experiments docs](/docs/datasets/overview) or run this [end-to-end example (Python Notebook)](/docs/datasets/python-cookbook).

### Analyze results

After successfully running your experiments, analyze results and scores produced by your evaluator in the Langfuse UI, using the [dataset experiment run comparison view](/changelog/2024-11-18-dataset-runs-comparison-view). Use the Langfuse UI to:

1. Compare metrics across experiment runs
2. Drill down into specific examples
3. Identify patterns in successes/failures
4. Track performance over time
5. Identify when to add more test cases to your dataset, as evaluation on test dataset is strong but production evaluation is weak

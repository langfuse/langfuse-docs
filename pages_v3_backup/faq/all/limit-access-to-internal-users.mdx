# How can I restrict access on my self-hosted instance to internal users?

If you expose your self-hosted Langfuse instance to the public internet, you may want to restrict access to only internal users.

**Recommended ways to restrict access:**

1. Disable email/password authentication (`AUTH_DISABLE_USERNAME_PASSWORD=true`)
2. Use an authentication provider supported by Langfuse, such as Google, GitHub, Okta, Auth0. See [docs](/self-hosting/security/authentication-and-sso) for details.
3. Configure your authentication provider to restrict access to only internal users.

**Optional: Restrict organization creation**

You can rely on an allowlist of _Organization Creators_ to restrict who can create new organizations. See [docs](/self-hosting/administration/organization-creators) for details.

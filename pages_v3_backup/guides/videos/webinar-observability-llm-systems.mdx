# Webinar: Traceability and Observability in Multi-Step LLM Systems

In this session, we talked about advanced techniques and best practices for implementing traceability and observability in multi-step LLM systems.

Topics that were covered:

- Multi-Step LLM Applications: Understanding the complexity of LLM systems that involve multiple steps, agents, and chains.
- Integration Example (RAG): A detailed examination of how RAG systems work. We'll demonstrate how user input, message history, and additional memory are combined to produce an aggregated response with accompanying sources.
- Traces for Observability: Learn about the role of traces in observability and how they serve as a powerful abstraction for logging and monitoring in both production and development environments.

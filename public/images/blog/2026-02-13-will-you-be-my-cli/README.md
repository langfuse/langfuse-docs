- **Dimensions**: 1200x630px (standard OG image size)

## Design Notes

The blog post has a playful Valentine's Day theme but stays technical and factual in content. The image should:
- Be eye-catching but professional
- Clearly represent the agent/CLI theme
- Include Valentine's Day elements (hearts, cupid references) in a tasteful way
- Work well as social media preview image

## Temporary Placeholder

Until the actual image is created, the blog post references:

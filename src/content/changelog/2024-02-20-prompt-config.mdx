<ChangelogHeader />

Previously, prompts in Langfuse only consisted of strings with `{{variables}}`. However, when using LLMs in an application/chain, there are many other parameters and data that are associated with the prompt that would benefit from being managed in [Langfuse Prompt Management](/docs/prompts).

We added the `config` attribute to prompts to store all of this extra structured data associated with the prompt. It is versioned together with the prompt and can be set/updated in the same way as the prompt string.

Examples of use cases:

- Model name
- Model parameters, such as `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens`, etc.
- Function/tool parameters
- JSON schemas

See [prompt management docs](/docs/prompts/get-started) for more details.

## Cookbooks

We've added two example cookbooks that demonstrate how to use the `config` attribute:

import { Terminal, FileCode } from "lucide-react";

<Cards num={2}>
  <Card
    title="Example OpenAI Functions"
    href="/guides/cookbook/prompt_management_openai_functions"
    icon={<FileCode />}
  />
  <Card
    title="Example Langchain (Python)"
    href="/guides/cookbook/prompt_management_langchain"
    icon={<FileCode />}
  />
</Cards>

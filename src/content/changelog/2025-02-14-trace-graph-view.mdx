We are excited to announce the launch of our graph view for LangGraph traces, marking our first step toward a generalized agent graph view.

When tracing complex agent orchestration with LangGraph, you can now visualize the conceptual agent graph while stepping through your execution's spans and generations. This visualization helps maintain context by clearly showing the hierarchy of each specific span within the agent graph.

This feature is currently in beta. We welcome your feedback and encourage you to share screenshots of your graphs with us on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/2669)!

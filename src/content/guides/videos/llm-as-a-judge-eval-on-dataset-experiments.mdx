# LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluators for Dataset Experiments

10 min walkthrough on how to reliably evaluate your LLM application changes using Langfuse's new managed LLM-as-a-judge evaluators.

This feature helps teams:

- Automatically evaluate experiment runs against test datasets
- Compare metrics across different versions
- Identify regressions before they hit production
- Score outputs based on criteria like hallucination, helpfulness, relevance, and more

Works with popular LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, and AWS Bedrock through function calling.
